<h2><!-- page v--><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
v</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book consists almost entirely of legends or traditions of
a varied character, referring to places and buildings in
Florence, such as the Cathedral and Campanile, the Signoria, the
Bargello, the different city gates, ancient towers and bridges,
palaces, crosses, and fountains, noted corners, odd by-ways, and
many churches.&nbsp; To all of these there are tales, or at least
anecdotes attached, which will be found as entertaining to the
general reader as they will be interesting, not to say valuable,
to the folklorist and the student of social history; but here I
must leave the work to speak for itself.</p>
<p>I originally intended that this should be entirely a
collection of relics of ancient mythology, with superstitions and
sorceries, witchcraft and incantations, or what may be called
occult folk-lore, of which my work on &ldquo;Etruscan-Roman
Remains in Popular Tradition&rdquo; consists, and of which I have
enough additional material to make a large volume.&nbsp; But
having resolved to add to it local legends, and give them the
preference, I found that the latter so abounded, and were so
easily collected by an expert, that I was obliged to cast out my
occult folk-lore, piece by piece, if I ever hoped to get into the
port of publication, according to terms with the underwriters,
following the principle laid down by the illustrious Poggio, <!--
page vi--><a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vi</span>that in a storm the heaviest things must go overboard
first, he illustrating the idea with the story of the Florentine,
who, having heard this from the captain when at sea in a tempest,
at once threw his wife into the raging billows&mdash;<i>perche
non haveva cosa pi&ugrave; grave di lei</i>&mdash;because there
was nought on earth which weighed on him so heavily.</p>
<p>There are several very excellent and pleasant works on Old
Florence, such as that portion devoted to it in the &ldquo;Cities
of Central Italy,&rdquo; by A. J. C. Hare; the &ldquo;Walks about
Florence,&rdquo; by the Sisters Horner; &ldquo;Florentine
Life,&rdquo; by Scaife; and the more recent and admirable book by
Leader Scott, which are all&mdash;I say it
advisedly&mdash;indispensable for those who would really know
something about a place which is unusually opulent in ancient,
adventurous, or artistic associations.&nbsp; My book is, however,
<i>entirely</i> different from these, and all which are
exclusively taken from authentic records and books.&nbsp; My
tales are, with a few exceptions, derived directly or indirectly
from the people themselves&mdash;having been recorded in the
local dialect&mdash;the exceptions being a few anecdotes racy of
the soil, taken from antique jest-books and such bygone halfpenny
literature as belonged to the multitude, and had its origin among
them.&nbsp; These I could not, indeed, well omit, as they every
one refer to some peculiar place in Florence.&nbsp; To these I
must add several which remained obscurely in my memory, but which
I did not record at the time of hearing or reading, not having
then the intention of publishing such a book.</p>
<p>It has been well observed by Wordsworth that minor local
legends sink more deeply into the soul than greater <!-- page
vii--><a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vii</span>histories, as is proved by the fact that romantic
folk-lore spreads far and wide over the world, completely
distancing in the race the records of mighty men and their
deeds.&nbsp; The magic of Washington Irving has cast over the
Catskills and the Hudson, by means of such tales, an
indescribable fascination, even as Scott made of all Scotland a
fairyland; for it is indisputable that a strange story, or one of
wild or quaint adventure, or even of humour, goes further to fix
a place in our memory than anything else can do.&nbsp; Therefore
I have great hope that these fairy-tales of Florence, and strange
fables of its fountains, palaces, and public places&mdash;as they
are truly gathered from old wives, and bear in themselves
unmistakable evidences of antiquity&mdash;will be of real use in
impressing on many memories much which is worth retaining, and
which would otherwise have been forgotten.</p>
<p>The manner in which these stories were collected was as
follows:&mdash;In the year 1886 I made the acquaintance in
Florence of a woman who was not only skilled in fortune-telling,
but who inherited as a family gift from generations, skill in
witchcraft&mdash;that is, a knowledge of mystical cures, the
relieving people who were bewitched, the making amulets, and who
had withal a memory stocked with a literally incredible number of
tales and names of spirits, with the invocations to them, and
strange rites and charms.&nbsp; She was a native of the Romagna
Toscana, where there still lurks in the recesses of the mountains
much antique Etrusco-Roman heathenism, though it is disappearing
very rapidly.&nbsp; Maddalena&mdash;such was her name&mdash;soon
began to communicate to me all her lore.&nbsp; <!-- page
viii--><a name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
viii</span>She could read and write, but beyond this never gave
the least indication of having opened a book of any kind; albeit
she had an immense library of folk-lore in her brain.&nbsp; When
she could not recall a tale or incantation, she would go about
among her extensive number of friends, and being perfectly
familiar with every dialect, whether Neapolitan, Bolognese,
Florentine, or Venetian, and the ways and manners of the poor,
and especially of witches, who are the great repositories of
legends, became in time wonderfully well skilled as a
collector.&nbsp; Now, as the proverb says, &ldquo;Take a thief to
catch a thief,&rdquo; so I found that to take a witch to catch
witches, or detect their secrets, was an infallible means to
acquire the arcana of sorcery.&nbsp; It was in this manner that I
gathered a great part of the lore given in my
&ldquo;Etruscan-Roman Remains.&rdquo;&nbsp; I however collected
enough, in all conscience, from other sources, and verified it
all sufficiently from classic writers, to fully test the honesty
of my authorities.</p>
<p>The witches in Italy form a class who are the repositories of
all the folk-lore; but, what is not at all generally known, they
also keep as strict secrets an <i>immense</i> number of legends
of their own, which have nothing in common with the nursery or
popular tales, such as are commonly collected and
published.&nbsp; The real witch-story is very often only a frame,
so to speak, the real picture within it being the <i>arcanum</i>
of a long <i>scongiurazione</i> or incantation, and what
ingredients were used to work the charm.&nbsp; I have given
numbers of these real witch-tales in my &ldquo;Etruscan-Roman
Remains,&rdquo; and a few, such as &ldquo;Orpheus and
Eurydice,&rdquo; &ldquo;Intialo,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Il
Moschone,&rdquo; in this work.</p>
<p>Lady Vere de Vere, who has investigated witchcraft as <!--
page ix--><a name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
ix</span>it exists in the Italian Tyrol, in an admirable article
in <i>La Rivista</i> of Rome (June 1894)&mdash;which article has
the only demerit of being too brief&mdash;tells us that
&ldquo;the Community of Italian Witches is regulated by laws,
traditions, and customs of the most secret kind, possessing
special recipes for sorcery,&rdquo; which is perfectly
true.&nbsp; Having been free of the community for years, I can
speak from experience.&nbsp; The more occult and singular of
their secrets are naturally not of a nature to be published, any
more than are those of the Voodoos.&nbsp; Some of the milder sort
may be found in the story of the &ldquo;Moscone, or Great
Fly,&rdquo; in this work.&nbsp; The great secret for scholars is,
however, that these pagans and heretics, who are the last who
cling to a heathen creed out-worn in Europe&mdash;these outcast
children of the Cainites, Ultra-Taborites, and similar ancient
worshippers of the devil, are really the ones who possess the
most valuable stores of folk-lore, that is to say, such as
illustrate the first origins of the religious Idea, its
development, and specially the evolution of the Opposition or
Protestant principle.</p>
<p>As regards the many legends in this book which do not
illustrate such serious research, it is but natural that witches,
who love and live in the Curious, should have preserved more even
of them than other people, and it was accordingly among her
colleagues of the mystic spell that Maddalena found tales which
would have been long sought for elsewhere, of which this book is
a most convincing proof in itself; for while I had resolved on
second thought to make it one of simple local tales, there still
hangs over most&mdash;even of these&mdash;a dim, unholy air of
sorcery, a witch <i>aura</i>, a lurid light, a something eerie
<!-- page x--><a name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
x</span>and uncanny, a restless hankering for the broom and the
supernatural.&nbsp; Those tales are Maddalena&rsquo;s every
line&mdash;I pray thee, reader, not to make them mine.&nbsp; The
spirit will always speak.</p>
<p>Very different, indeed, from these are the contributions of
Marietta Pery, the <i>improvvisatrice</i>, though even she in
good faith, and not for fun, had a horseshoe for luck; which,
however, being of an artistic turn, she had elegantly gilded, and
also, like a true Italian, wore an amulet.&nbsp; She, too, knew
many fairy tales, but they were chiefly such as may be found
among the <i>Racconti delle Fate</i>, and the variants which are
now so liberally published.&nbsp; She had, however, a rare, I may
almost say a refined, taste in these, as the poems which I have
given indicate.</p>
<p>I must also express my obligations to Miss Roma Lister, a lady
born in Italy of English parentage, who is an accomplished
folk-lorist and collector, as was shown by her paper on the
<i>Legends of the Castelli Romani</i>, read at the first meeting
of the Italian Folk-Lore Society, founded by Count Angelo de
Gubernatis, the learned and accomplished Oriental scholar, and
editor of <i>La Rivista</i>.&nbsp; I would here say that her
researches in the vicinity of Rome have gone far to corroborate
what I published in the &ldquo;Etruscan-Roman
Remains.&rdquo;&nbsp; I must also thank Miss Teresa Wyndham for
sundry kind assistances, when I was ill in Siena.</p>
<p>There is no city in the world where, within such narrow limit,
Art, Nature, and History have done so much to make a place
beautiful and interesting as Florence.&nbsp; It is one where we
feel that there has been vivid and varied <i>life</i>&mdash;life
such as was led by Benvenuto Cellini and a <!-- page xi--><a
name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xi</span>thousand like
him&mdash;and we long more than elsewhere to enter into it, and
know how those men in quaint and picturesque garb thought and
felt four hundred years ago.&nbsp; Now, as at the present day
politics and news do not enter into our habits of thought more
than goblins, spirits of fountains and bridges, legends of
palaces and towers, and quaint jests of friar or squire, did into
those of the olden time, I cannot help believing that this book
will be not only entertaining, but useful to all who would study
the spirit of history thoroughly.&nbsp; The folk-lore of the
future has a far higher mission than has as yet been dreamed for
it; it is destined to revive for us the inner sentiment or
habitual and peculiar life of man as he was in the olden time
more perfectly than it has been achieved by fiction.&nbsp; This
will be done by bringing before the reader the facts or
<i>phenomena</i> of that life itself in more vivid and familiar
form.&nbsp; Admitting this, the reader can hardly fail to see
that the writer who gathers up with pains whatever he can collect
of such materials as this book contains does at least some slight
service to Science.</p>
<p>And to conclude&mdash;with the thing to which I would
specially call attention&mdash;I distinctly state that (as will
be very evident to the critical reader) there are in this book,
especially in the second series, which I hope to bring out later,
certain tales, or anecdotes, or jests, which are either based on
a very slight foundation of tradition&mdash;often a mere
hint&mdash;or have been so &ldquo;written up&rdquo; by a runaway
pen&mdash;and mine is an &ldquo;awful bolter&rdquo;&mdash;that
the second-rate folk-lorist, whose forte consists not in finding
facts but faults, may say in truth, as one of his kind did in
America: &ldquo;Mr. Leland is throughout <!-- page xii--><a
name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xii</span>inaccurate.&rdquo;&nbsp; In these numerous instances,
which are only &ldquo;folk-lore&rdquo; run wild, as Rip Van
Winkle, Sleepy Hollow, and Heine&rsquo;s Gods in Exile are
legend, I have, I hope, preserved a certain <i>spirit</i> of
truth, though I have <i>sans mercy</i> sacrificed the letter,
even as the redcap goblins, which haunt old houses, are said to
be the ghosts of infants sacrificed by witches, or slain by their
mothers, in order to make <i>folletti</i> or imps of them.</p>
<p>Now as for this reconstructing Hercules from a foot, instead
of giving the fragment, at which few would have glanced, the
success consists in the skill attained, and the approbation of
the reader.&nbsp; And with this frank admission, that in a
certain number of these tales the utmost liberty has been taken,
I conclude.</p>

1</span>THE THREE HORNS OF MESSER GUICCIARDINI</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;More plenty than the fabled horn<br />
Thrice emptied could pour forth at banqueting.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Keats</span>, <i>The Earlier Version of</i>
&ldquo;<i>Hyperion</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prosperity is often our worst enemy, making us vicious,
frivolous, and insolent, so that to bear it well is a better test
of a man than to endure adversity.&rdquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Gicciardini</span>, <i>Maxims</i>, No. 64.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I did not know when I first read and translated the following
story, which was obtained for me and written out by Maddalena,
that it had any reference to the celebrated historian and
moralist, Guicciardini.&nbsp; How I did so forms the subject of a
somewhat singular little incident, which I will subsequently
relate.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Le Tre
Corne</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was an elderly man, a very good, kind-hearted,
wise person, who was gentle and gay with every one, and much
beloved by his servants, because they always found him <i>buono
ed allegro</i>&mdash;pleasant and jolly.&nbsp; And often when
with them while they were at their work, he would say,
&lsquo;<i>Felice voi poveri</i>!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Oh, how
lucky you are to be poor!&rsquo;&nbsp; And they would reply to
him, singing in the old Tuscan fashion, because they knew it
pleased him:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O caro Signor, you have gold in
store,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With all to divert yourself;<br />
Your bees make honey, you&rsquo;ve plenty of money,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And victuals upon the shelf:<br />
A palace you have, and rich attire,<br />
And everything to your heart&rsquo;s desire.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>&ldquo;Then he would reply merrily:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My dear good folk, because you are
poor<br />
You are my friends, and all the more,<br />
For the poor are polite to all they see,<br />
And therefore blessed be Poverty!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Then a second servant sang:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh bello gentile mio
Signor&rsquo;,<br />
Your praise of poverty &rsquo;d soon be o&rsquo;er<br />
If you yourself for a time were poor;<br />
For nothing to eat, and water to drink,<br />
Isn&rsquo;t so nice as you seem to think,<br />
And a lord who lives in luxury<br />
Don&rsquo;t know the pressure of poverty.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Then all would laugh, and the jolly old lord would sing
in his turn:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O charo servitor&rsquo;,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tu parli tanto bene,<br />
Ma il tuo parlar<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A me non mi conviene.&rsquo; . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My boy, you answer well,<br />
But with false implication;<br />
For what to me you tell<br />
Has no true application;<br />
How oft I heard you say<br />
(You know &rsquo;tis true, you sinner!)<br />
&ldquo;I am half-starved to-day,<br />
How I&rsquo;ll enjoy my dinner!&rdquo;<br />
Your hunger gives you health<br />
And causes great delight,<br />
While I with all my wealth<br />
Have not an appetite.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Then another servant sang, laughing:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dear master, proverbs say,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I have heard them from my birth,<br />
That of all frightful beasts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which walk upon the earth,<br />
Until we reach the bier,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherever man may be,<br />
There&rsquo;s nothing which we fear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So much as poverty.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And so one evening as they were merrily improvising and
throwing <i>stornelli</i> at one another in this fashion, the
Signore went to his street-door, and there beheld three ladies of
stately form; for though they were veiled and dressed in the
plainest black long robes, it was evident that they were of high
rank.&nbsp; Therefore the old lord saluted them courteously, and
seeing <!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>that they were strangers, asked them whither they were
going.&nbsp; But he had first of all had them politely escorted
by his servants into his best reception-room. <a
name="citation3a"></a><a href="#footnote3a"
class="citation">[3a]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;And the one who appeared to be the chief replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Truly we know not where we shall lodge, for in
all Florence there is, I trow, not a soul who, knowing who we are
would receive us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And who art thou, lady?&rsquo; asked the
Signore.&nbsp; And she replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Io mi chiamo, e sono,<br />
La Poverta in persona,<br />
E queste due donzelle,<br />
Sono le mie sorelle,<br />
Chi voi non conoscete<br />
La Fame e la Sete!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am one whom all throw curse on.<br />
I am Poverty in person;<br />
Of these ladies here, the younger<br />
Is my sister, known as Hunger,<br />
And the third, who&rsquo;s not the worst,<br />
Is dreaded still by all as Thirst.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Blessed be the hour in which ye entered my
house!&rsquo; cried the Signore, delighted.&nbsp; &lsquo;Make
yourselves at home, rest and be at ease as long as you
like&mdash;<i>sempre sarei benglieto</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And why are you so well disposed towards
me?&rsquo; inquired Poverty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Because, lady, I am, I trust, sufficiently wise
with years and experience to know that everything must not be
judged from the surface.&nbsp; Great and good art thou, since but
for thee the devil a beggar in the world would ever move a finger
to do the least work, and we should all be in mouldy green
misery.&nbsp; Well hath it been said that &lsquo;Need makes the
old woman trot,&rsquo; <a name="citation3b"></a><a
href="#footnote3b" class="citation">[3b]</a> and likewise that
<i>Poverta non guasta gentilezza</i>&mdash;&lsquo;Poverty doth
not degrade true nobility,&rsquo; as I can perceive by thy
manner, O noble lady.&nbsp; Thou, Poverty, art the mother of
Industry, and grandmother of Wealth, Health, and Art; thou makest
all men work; but for thee there would be no harvests, yea, all
the fine things in the world are due to Want.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;And I?&rsquo; said Dame Hunger.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Dost thou also love me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Si</i>, <i>Dio ti benedicha</i>!&rsquo;
replied the Signore.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>La fame ghastiga il
ghiotto</i>&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Hunger corrects gluttony.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hunger causes our delight,<br />
For it gives us appetite;<br />
For dainties without hunger sent<br />
Form a double punishment.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Hunger is the best sauce.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thou makest men
bold, for <i>chane affamato non prezza bastone</i>&mdash;a hungry
dog fears no stick.&nbsp; Thou makest the happiness of every
feast.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Ed io</i>, <i>Signore</i>?&rsquo; said
Thirst.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hast thou also a good word for
me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>A Dio</i>, <i>grazie</i>!&nbsp; God be
praised that thou art.&nbsp; For without thee I should have no
wine.&nbsp; Nor do men speak in pity of any one when they say in
a wine-shop, &ldquo;He is thirsty enough to drink up the
Arno.&rdquo;&nbsp; I remember a Venetian who once said, coming to
a feast, &ldquo;I would not take five gold <i>zecchini</i> for
this thirst which I now have.&rdquo;&nbsp; And to sum it all up,
I find that poverty with want to urge it is better than wealth
without power to enjoy, and, taking one with another, the poor
are honester and have better hearts than the rich.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Truly thou art great,&rsquo; replied
Poverty.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Gentile</i>, <i>buono</i>, <i>e
galantuomo a parlare</i>&mdash;gentle, good, and noble in thy
speech.&nbsp; In such wise thou wilt ever be rich, for as thou
art rich thou art good and charitable.&nbsp; And thou hast well
said that Plenty comes from us, and it is we who truly own the
horn of plenty; and therefore take from me this horn as a gift,
and while thou livest be as rich as thou art good and
wise!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And I,&rsquo; said Hunger, &lsquo;give thee
another, and while it is thine thou shalt never want either a
good appetite nor the means to gratify it.&nbsp; For thou hast
seen the truth that I was not created to starve men to death, but
to keep them from starving.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And I,&rsquo; said Thirst, &lsquo;give thee a
third horn of plenty; that is, plenty of wine and temperate
desire&mdash;<i>e buon pro vi faccia</i>.&nbsp; Much good may it
do you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saying this they vanished, and he would have thought it
all a dream but for the three horns which they left behind
them.&nbsp; So he had a long life and a happy, and in gratitude
to his benefactresses he placed on his shield three horns, as men
may see them to this day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>When I received this legend, I did not know that the <!-- page
5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>three
horns on a shield form the coat of arms of Messer Guicciardini,
the historian, nor had I ever seen them.&nbsp; It happened by
pure chance I went one day with my wife and Miss Roma Lister, who
is devoted to folk-lore, to make my first visit to Sir John Edgar
at his home, the celebrated old medi&aelig;val palazzo, the Villa
Guicciardini, Via Montugli.</p>
<p>On the way we passed the Church of the Annunciata, and while
driving by I remarked that there were on its wall, among many
shields, several which had on them a <i>single</i> hunting-horn,
but that I had never seen three together, but had heard of such a
device, and was very anxious to find it, and learn to what family
it belonged.</p>
<p>What was my astonishment, on arriving at the villa or palazzo,
at beholding on the wall in the court a large shield bearing the
three horns.&nbsp; Sir John Edgar informed me that it was the
shield of the Guicciardini family, who at one time inhabited the
mansion.&nbsp; I related to him the story, and he said, &ldquo;I
should think that tale had been invented by some one who knew
Guicciardini, the author, very well, for it is perfectly inspired
with the spirit of his writings.&nbsp; It depicts the man himself
as I have conceived him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then we went into the library, where my host showed me
Fenton&rsquo;s translation of the &ldquo;History&rdquo; of
Guicciardini and his &ldquo;Maxims&rdquo; in Italian, remarking
that the one which I have placed as motto to this chapter was in
fact an epitome of the whole legend.</p>
<p>I should observe, what did not before occur to me, that the
family palace of the Guicciardini is in the Via Guicciardini,
nearly opposite to the house of Machiavelli, and that it is there
that the fairies probably called, if it was in the
winter-time.</p>

6</span>THE PILLS OF THE MEDICI</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When I upon a time was somewhat ill,<br />
Then every man did press on me a cure;<br />
And when my wife departed, all of them<br />
Came crowding round, commending me a spouse;<br />
But now my ass is dead, not one of them<br />
Has offered me another&mdash;devil a one!&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Spanish
Jests</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Tu vai cercando il mal</i>, <i>come fanno i
Medici</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Thou goest about seeking evil,

<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1618.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The higher a tree grows, the more do petty animals burrow into
its roots, and displace the dirt to show how it grew in lowly
earth; and so it is with great families, who never want for such
investigators, as appears by the following tale, which refers to
the origin of the Medicis, yet which is withal rather merry than
malicious.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">D&rsquo;uno
Medico che curava gli Asini</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was long ago&mdash;so long, Signore Carlo, that the
oldest olive-tree in Tuscany had not been planted, and when
wolves sometimes came across the Ponte Vecchio into the town to
look into the shop-windows, and ghosts and witches were as common
by night as Christians by day, that there was a man in Florence
who hated work, and who had observed, early as the age was, that
those who laboured the least were the best paid.&nbsp; And he was
always repeating to himself:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Con arte e con inganno,<br />
Si vive mezzo l&rsquo;anno,<br />
Con inganno, e con arte,<br />
Si vive l&rsquo;altra parte.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Or in English:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;With tricks and cleverness,
&rsquo;tis clear,<br />
A man can live six months i&rsquo; the year,<br />
And then with cleverness and tricks<br />
He&rsquo;ll live as well the other six.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>&ldquo;Now having come across a recipe for making pills
which were guaranteed to cure everything, he resolved to set up
for an universal doctor, and that with nothing but the pills to
aid.&nbsp; So he went forth from Florence, wandering from one
village to another, selling his pills, curing some people, and
getting, as often happens, fame far beyond his deserts, so that
the peasants began to believe he could remedy all earthly
ills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And at last one day a stupid contadino, who had lost
his ass, went to the doctor and asked him whether by his art and
learning he could recover for him the missing animal.&nbsp;
Whereupon the doctor gave him six pills at a <i>quattrino</i> (a
farthing) each, and bade him wander forth thinking intently all
the time on the delinquent donkey, and, to perfect the spell, to
walk in all the devious ways and little travelled tracks,
solitary by-paths, and lonely <i>sentieri</i>, ever repeating
solemnly, &lsquo;<i>Asino mio</i>! <i>asino mio</i>!&nbsp; <i>Tu
che amo come un zio</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh my ass! my ass! my ass!<br />
Whom I loved like an uncle,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alas! alas!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And having done this for three days, it came to pass,
and no great wonder either, that he found Signore Somaro (or Don
Key) comfortably feasting in a dark lane on thistles.&nbsp; After
which he praised to the skies the virtue of the wonderful pills,
by means of which one could find strayed cattle.&nbsp; And from
this dated the doctor&rsquo;s success, so that he grew rich and
founded the family of the Medici, who, in commemoration of this
their great ancestor, put the six pills into their shield, as you
may see all over Florence to this day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There is given in the &ldquo;Facezie&rdquo; a story which may
be intended as a jest on this family.&nbsp; It is as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It happened once that a certain doctor or
<i>medico</i>, who was by no means wanting in <i>temerita</i> or
bold self-conceit, was sent as ambassador to Giovanna la Superba,
or Joanna the Proud, Queen of Naples.&nbsp; And this Florentine
Medico having heard many tales of the gallantries of the royal
lady, thought he would try the chance, and thereby greatly please
himself, and also the better advance his political aims.&nbsp;
Therefore, at the first interview, he told her that he was
charged with a secret mission, which could only be confided to
her &lsquo;between <!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>four eyes,&rsquo; or in private.&nbsp;
So he was taken by her into a room, where he bluntly made a
proposal of love. <a name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8"
class="citation">[8]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the Queen, not in the least discomposed, looking
straight at him, asked if that was one of the questions or
demands with which he had been charged by the Florentines.&nbsp;
At which he blushed like a beet and had no more to say, having
learned that a bold beggar deserves a stern refusal.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The name of the Medici naturally gave rise to many jests, and
one of these is narrated of Gonella, a famous
<i>farceur</i>.&nbsp; It is as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;One morning, at the table of the Grand Duke
Lorenzo, there was a discussion as to the number and proportion
of those who followed different trades and callings, one
declaring that there were more clothmakers, another more priests
than any others, till at last the host asked Gonella his
opinion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am sure,&rsquo; said Gonella, &lsquo;that
there are more doctors than any other kind of people&mdash;<i>e
non accade dubitarne</i>&mdash;and there is no use in doubting
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Little do you know about it,&rsquo; replied the
Duke, &lsquo;if you do not know that in all this city there are
only two or three accredited physicians.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;With how little knowledge,&rsquo; answered
Gonella, &lsquo;can a state be governed.&nbsp; It seems, O
Excellency, that you have so much to do that you do not know what
is in your city, nor what the citizens do.&rsquo;&nbsp; And the
result of the debate was a bet, and Gonella took every bet
offered, his stakes being small and the others great&mdash;<i>A
quattrino e quattrino si fa il fiorino</i>&mdash;Farthings to
farthings one by one make a pound when all is done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next morning Gonella, having well wrapped up his
throat and face in woollen stuff, stood, looking pitifully
enough, at the door of the Duomo, and every one who passed asked
him what was the matter, to which he replied, &lsquo;All my teeth
ache terribly.&rsquo;&nbsp; And everybody offered him an
infallible remedy, which he noted down, and with it the name of
him who gave it.&nbsp; And then going about town, he made out
during the day a list of three hundred prescribers, with as many
prescriptions.</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>&ldquo;And last of all he went to the palace at the hour
of supper, and the Grand Duke seeing him so wrapped up, asked the
cause, and hearing that it was toothache, also prescribed a
sovereign remedy, and Gonella put it with the name of the Duke at
the head of the list.&nbsp; And going home, he had the whole
fairly engrossed, and the next day, returning to the palace, was
reminded of his bets.&nbsp; Whereupon he produced the paper, and
great was the laughter which it caused, since it appeared by it
that all the first citizens and nobles of Florence were
physicians, and that the Grand Duke himself was their first
Medico.&nbsp; So it was generally admitted that Gonella had won,
and they paid him the money, with which he made merry for many
days.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This tale has been retold by many a writer, but by none better
than by an American feuilletoniste, who improved it by giving a
number of the prescriptions commended.&nbsp; Truly it has been
well said that at forty years of age every man is either a fool
or a physician.</p>
<p>I have another legend of the Medici, in which it is declared
that their armorial symbol is a key, and in which they are spoken
of as wicked and cruel.&nbsp; It is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">I
Medici</span>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Palazzo Medici is situated in the Borgo
degli Albizzi, and this palace is called by the people <i>I
Visacchi</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, figures or faces), because there are
to be seen in it many figures of people who were when alive all
witches and wizards, but who now live a life in death in
stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The arms of the Medici bear a great key, and it is said
that this was a sorcerer&rsquo;s or magic key, which belonged to
the master of all the wizards or to the queen of the witches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And being ever evil at heart and cruelly wicked, the
old Medici sought restlessly every opportunity to do wrong, which
was greatly aided by the queen of the witches herself, who
entered the family, and allied herself to one of it; others say
she was its first ancestress.&nbsp; And that being on her
death-bed, she called her husband, or son, or the family, and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Take this key, and when I am dead, open a
certain door in the cellar, which, through secret passages, leads
to an <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>enchanted garden, in which you will
find all the books and apparatus needed to acquire great skill in
sorcery, and thus thou canst do all the evil and enjoy all the
crime that a great ruler can desire; spare not man in thy
vengeance, nor woman in thy passion; he lives best who wishes for
most and gets what he wants.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus it came to pass that the Medici became such
villains, and why they bear a key.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Villains they may have been, but they were not so deficient in
moral dignity as a friend of mine, who, observing that one of the
pills in their scutcheon is blue, remarked that they were the
first to take a blue pill.</p>
<p>Since the above was written I have collected many more, and
indeed far more interesting and amusing legends of the Medici;
especially several referring to Lorenzo the Magnificent, which
are not given by any writer that I am aware of.&nbsp; These will
appear, I trust, in a second series.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A race which was the reflex of an age<br />
So strange, so flashed with glory, so bestarred<br />
With splendid deeds, so flushed with rainbow hues,<br />
That one forgot the dark abyss of night<br />
Which covered it at last when all was o&rsquo;er.<br />
Take all that&rsquo;s evil and unto it add<br />
All that is glorious, and the result<br />
Will be, in one brief word, the Medici.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;E un figliuolo della gallina

</blockquote>
<p>The Mercato Vecchio was fertile in local traditions, and one
of these is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Legend of the
Lanterns</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was in the Old Market of Florence an old house
with a small shop in it, and over the door was the figure or
bas-relief of a pretty hen, to show that eggs were sold
there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the neighbours were puzzled to know how the woman
who kept this shop could sell so many eggs as she did, or whence
she obtained them, for she was never seen in the market buying
any, nor were they brought to her; whence they concluded that she
was a witch and an egg-maker, and this scandal was especially
spread by her rivals in business.&nbsp; But others found her a
very good person, of kindly manner, and it was noted in time that
she not only did a great deal of good in charity, and that her
eggs were not only always fresh and warm, but that many persons
who had drunk them when ill had been at once relieved, and
recovered in consequence.&nbsp; And the name of this egg-wife was
Furicchia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now there was an old lady who had gone down in the
world or become poor, and she too had set up a shop to sell eggs,
but did not succeed, chiefly because everybody went to
Furicchia.&nbsp; And this made the former more intent than ever
to discover the secret, and she at once went to work to find it
out.</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>&ldquo;Every morning early, when Furicchia rose, she
went out of doors, and then the hen carved over the door came
down as a beautiful white fowl, who told her all the slanders and
gossip which people spread about her, and what effort was being
made to discover her secret.&nbsp; And one day it said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There is the Signora who was once rich and who
is now poor, and who has sworn to find out thy secret how thou
canst have so many eggs to sell, since no one sees thee buy any,
and how it comes that invalids and bewitched children are at once
cured by the virtue of those eggs.&nbsp; So she hopes to bring
thee to death, and to get all thy trade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But, dear Furicchia, this shall never be,
because I will save thee.&nbsp; I well remember how, when I was a
little chicken, and the poultry dealer had bought me, and was
about to wring my neck&mdash;b&rsquo;r&rsquo;r&rsquo;r!&mdash;I
shudder when I think of it!&mdash;when thou didst save my life,
and I will ever be grateful to thee, and care for thy
fortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now I will tell thee what to do.&nbsp; Thou
shalt to-morrow take a pot and fill it with good wine and certain
drugs, and boil them well, and leave it all hot in thy room, and
then go forth, and for the rest I will provide.&nbsp;
<i>Addio</i>, Furicchia!&rsquo;&nbsp; And saying this, the hen
went back into her accustomed place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the next morning, Furicchia, having left the wine
boiling, went forth at ten o&rsquo;clock, and she was hardly gone
ere the Signora, her rival, entered the place and called for the
mistress, but got no answer.&nbsp; Then she went into the house,
but saw nothing more than a vast quantity of eggs, and all the
while she heard the hen singing or clucking:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Coccod&eacute;</i>!&nbsp; Dear
me!<br />
Where can Furicchia be?<br />
<i>Coccod&eacute;</i>!&nbsp; Furicchia mine!<br />
Bring me quick some warm red wine!<br />
<i>Coccod&eacute;</i>!&nbsp; Three eggs I have laid!<br />
<i>Coccod&eacute;</i>!&nbsp; Now six for your trade.<br />
<i>Coccod&eacute;</i>!&nbsp; Now there are nine,<br />
Bring me quickly the warm red wine!<br />
<i>Coccod&eacute;</i>!&nbsp; Take them away;<br />
Many more for thee will I lay,<br />
And thou wilt be a lady grand,<br />
As fine as any in all the land;<br />
And should it happen that any one<br />
Drinks of this wine as I have done,<br />
Eggs like me she will surely lay;<br />
That is the secret, that is the way.<br />
<i>Coccod&eacute;</i>!&nbsp; <i>Coccod&eacute;</i>!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>&ldquo;Now the Signora heard all this, and knew not
whence the song came, but she found the pot of hot wine and drank
it nearly all, but had not time to finish it nor to escape before
Furicchia returned.&nbsp; And the latter began to scold her
visitor for taking such liberty, to which the Signora replied,
&lsquo;Furicchia, I came in here to buy an egg, and being
shivering with cold, and seeing this hot wine, I drank it,
meaning indeed to pay for it.&rsquo;&nbsp; But Furicchia replied,
&lsquo;Get thee gone; thou hast only come here to spy out my
secret, and much good may it do thee!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Signora went home, when she begun to feel great
pain, and also, in spite of herself, to cluck like a hen, to the
amazement of everybody, and then sang:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Coccod&eacute;</i>!&nbsp; Che mal
di corpo!<br />
<i>Coccod&eacute;</i>!&nbsp; Voglio fa l&rsquo;uovo!<br />
E se l&rsquo;uova non faro,<br />
Di dolore moriro.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Coccod&eacute;</i>!&nbsp; What a pain in my
leg!<br />
<i>Coccod&eacute;</i>!&nbsp; I must lay an egg!<br />
And if my eggs I cannot lay,<br />
I shall surely die to-day.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Then she began to lay eggs indeed&mdash;<i>tante</i>,
<i>tante</i>&mdash;till they nearly filled all the room, and
truly her friends were aghast at such a sight, never having heard
of such a thing before; but she replied, &lsquo;Keep quiet; it is
a secret.&nbsp; I have found out how Furicchia gets her eggs, and
we shall be as rich as she.&rsquo;&nbsp; And having laid her
eggs, nothing would do but she must needs hatch them, and all the
time for many days she sat and sat, clucking like a
hen&mdash;<i>coccod&eacute;</i>! <i>coccod&eacute;</i>!&mdash;and
pecking at crusts like a hen, for she would not eat in any other
way.&nbsp; And so she sat and shrivelled up until she became a
hen indeed, and was never anything else, and died one.&nbsp; But
when the eggs hatched, there came from them not chicks, but mice,
which ran away into the cellar, and so ends the story.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>This story greatly resembles one given by Peter Goldschmidt in
&ldquo;The Witches&rsquo; and Sorcerers&rsquo; Advocate
Overthrown,&rdquo; published at Hamburg in 1705, and to the same
as sung in Latin song by a certain Steuccius.&nbsp; The Italian
tale is, however, far better told in every respect, the only
point in common being that a certain witch laid <!-- page 14--><a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>eggs by means
of a potion, which produced the same effect on a man.&nbsp; It is
the well-managed play of curiosity, gratitude, and character
which make Furicchia so entertaining, and there is nothing in the
heavy German tale like the &ldquo;Song of the Hen,&rdquo; or
<i>Coccod&eacute;</i>, which is a masterpiece of a juvenile
lyric.&nbsp; The clucking and pecking at crusts of the old woman,
as she gradually passes into a hen, is well imagined, and also
the finale of the chickens turned to mice, who all run
away.&nbsp; One could make of it a play for the nursery or the
stage.</p>
<p>The Mercato Vecchio, in which the egg-wife dwelt, was a place
of common resort in the olden time, &ldquo;when there was giving
and taking of talk on topics temporal:&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Where the good news fleetly flew,<br />
And the bad news ever true,<br />
Softly whispered, loudly told,<br />
Scalding hot or freezing cold.&rdquo; <a name="citation14"></a><a
href="#footnote14" class="citation">[14]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This place is recalled by a story which is indeed to be found
in the faceti&aelig; of the Florentine Poggio, yet which holds
its own to this day in popular tale-telling.&nbsp; It is as
follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It happened once when Florence was at war
with the Duke of Milan, that a law was passed making it death for
any one to speak in any way of peace.&nbsp; Now there was a
certain Bernardo Manetti, a man <i>di ingegno vivacissimo</i>, or
an extremely ready wit, who being one day in the Mercato Vecchio
to buy something or other (it being the custom of the Florentines
of those times to go in person to purchase their daily food), was
much annoyed by one of those begging friars who go about the
roads, <i>alla questua</i>, collecting alms, and who stand at
street-corners imploring charity.&nbsp; And this brazen beggar,
accosting Bernardo, said to him:</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Pax vobiscum</i>!&nbsp; Peace be unto
you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>A chi parlasti di pace</i>?&mdash;How darest
thou speak to me of <i>peace</i>, thou traitor and enemy to
Florence?&rsquo; cried Bernardo in well-assumed anger.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Dost thou not know that by public decree thou may&rsquo;st
lose thy shaven head for mentioning the word?&nbsp; And thou
darest ask me for alms here in the open market-place, thou
traitor to thy country and thy God!&nbsp; <i>Apage</i>,
<i>Satanas</i>&mdash;avaunt!&mdash;begone! lest I be seen talking
to thee and taken for a conspirator myself!&nbsp; <i>Pax</i>
indeed&mdash;pack off with you, ere I hand you over to the
torturers!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so he rid himself of that importunate
beggar.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apropos of the egg-wife, if chickens are apropos to eggs,
there is a merry tale of a certain priest, which will, I think,
amuse the reader.&nbsp; Like all good folk, the Florentines make
fun of their neighbours, among whom are of course included the
people of Arezzo, and tell of them this story:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Long long ago, a certain Bishop Angelico
convoked a Synod at Arezzo, summoning every priest in his diocese
to be present; and knowing that many had slipped into very
slovenly habits as regarded the sacerdotal uniform, made it a
stern and strict order that every one should appear in <i>cappa e
cotta</i>,&rsquo; <a name="citation15"></a><a href="#footnote15"
class="citation">[15]</a> or in cloak and robe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now there was a priest who, though he kept a
well-filled cellar, and a pretty servant-maid, and a fine
poultry-yard, had none of these clerical vestments, and knew not
where to borrow them for the occasion; so he was in great
distress and <i>stavasi molto afflitto in casa sua</i>&mdash;sat
in deep affliction in his home.&nbsp; And his maid, who was a
bright and clever girl, seeing him so cast down, asked him the
cause of his grief, to which he replied that the Bishop had
summoned him to appear at the Synod in <i>cappa e cotta</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, nonsense!&rsquo; replied the good
girl.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is that all?&nbsp; My dear master, you do not
pronounce the words quite correctly, or else they have been badly
reported to you.&nbsp; It is not <i>cappa e cotta</i> which the
Bishop requires, for assuredly he has plenty of such clothes, but
<i>capponi cotti</i>, &lsquo;good roast capons,&rsquo; such as
all bishops love, and which he knows he can get better from <!--
page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>the country priests than from anybody.&nbsp; And
<i>grazie a Dio</i>! there is nobody in all Tuscany has better
poultry than ours, and I will take good care that you give the
Bishop of the very best.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the priest being persuaded by the maid, really made
his appearance at the Council bearing in a dish well covered with
a napkin four of the finest roasted capons ever seen.&nbsp; And
with these he advanced <i>in pleno concilo</i>, in full assembly
before the Bishop.&nbsp; The great man looked severely at the
priest, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where are thy <i>cappa e cotta</i>?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Excellenza, behold them!&rsquo; said the good
man, uncovering the dish.&nbsp; &lsquo;And though I say it, no
better <i>capponi cotte</i> can be had in all our
country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bishop and all round him gazed with breathless
admiration on the fowls, so plump, so delicious, so exquisitely
roasted, with lemons ranged round them.&nbsp; It was just the
hungry time of day, and, in short, the priest had made a blessed
happy blunder, and one which was greatly admired.&nbsp; There was
general applause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Figlio mio</i>!&rsquo; said the Bishop with a
smile, &lsquo;take my blessing!&nbsp; Thou alone of all the
ministers of our diocese didst rightly understand the spirit and
meaning of an episcopal edict.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

17</span>THE LANTERNS OF THE STROZZI PALACE</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And what this man did was, as the proverb
says, <i>mostrare altrui lucciole per laterne</i>&mdash;made him
believe that fire-flies were lanterns&mdash;which means to
deceive any one.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Italian Proverbs</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As all visitors to Florence will have their attention called
to the Strozzi Palace, and its rings and lanterns, the following
will probably prove to them to be of interest:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The <i>campanelle</i>, or great iron rings,
which are on the Strozzi Palace, were the result of rivalry with
the Pitti family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Strozzi built their palace first, and then the
Pitti said that it would only fill a corner of their own far
greater building.&nbsp; And when the latter was finished, the
Strozzi, to be even with them, placed those magnificent
<i>campanelle</i> at the four corners, and then the great
lanterns which are so exquisitely worked, and these were made by
Niccol&ograve; il Grosso, a very ingenious but also very poor
man, who, having begun the work, could not finish it for want of
money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One morning when this Niccolo was sitting on the stone
bench of the palace, there came by an old man who was carrying
some onions, and the artist begged a few of these to eat with his
bread, telling him he had no money.&nbsp; But the old man said,
&lsquo;Take them, and welcome, for a free gift,
Niccol&ograve;.&nbsp; Truly, it pains me to see an excellent
artist like thee starving for want of proper patronage.&nbsp; Now
I will lend thee a round sum, which thou canst repay me when thou
art in better luck.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But tell me,&rsquo; inquired Niccol&ograve;,
greatly amazed, &lsquo;how dost thou know who I am?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old man replied, &lsquo;I know thee, and that thou
hast great genius (<i>una gran testa</i>), and I find thee
utterly poor and unable to finish the Strozzi lanterns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now I wish to do thee a service.&nbsp; Go, with
these onions in thine hand, and stand there in the street till
the Lords Strozzi go forth, and see thee with the vegetables, and
then they will <!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>ask thee why thou dost not finish the
lanterns.&nbsp; And then thou shalt reply, &ldquo;Signori,
because I must sell onions, not being able otherwise to finish
the lanterns, for truly all my art does not give me
bread.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then they will give thee money, and after
that return to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it happened as the old man said: the Signori
Strozzi, when they came forth, found Niccol&ograve; their artist
selling onions, and gave him a good sum of money, and with that
he went back to the old man.&nbsp; And they gave him a great sum
indeed, for he was to make the lanterns all of solid gold, so
that the palace might be far finer than the Pitti.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old man said, &lsquo;Never mind paying me, but put
an onion in your pocket and study it.&rsquo;&nbsp; And this he
did, hence it comes that the tops of the lanterns are like onion
sprouts.&nbsp; And Niccol&ograve; seeing that he lived in a hard
and cruel world, in order to be even with it, made the lanterns
of iron, though the work which he put upon it was like jewellery,
so fine was it, and then gilded the iron and passed the lanterns
off on the Signori Strozzi for solid gold, and was soon heard of
as being very far away from Florence, in company with the good
old man who had put him up to the little game (<i>bel
giuoco</i>).</p>
<p>&ldquo;But people say that after all the Strozzi were not so
badly cheated, for those onion-top lanterns could not have been
bought even in their time for their weight in gold, and that they
are worth much more now.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is needless to say that this ingenious tale owes its origin
to the iron lanterns having been at one time gilt.&nbsp; These
famous works of art have been copied far and wide: had the
Strozzi family taken out and renewed the copyright for design on
them, they might have found that the gold was a very good
investment, especially in these times, when a thing of beauty
brings in cash for ever.&nbsp; One of the latest and prettiest
devices, to be seen in many shops, is a small iron night-lamp in
imitation of these Strozzi lanterns.</p>
<p>The im-moral, or at least the concluding sentence of the tale
is, &ldquo;<i>E cos&igrave; Niccol&ograve; se ne fuggi a tasche
piene</i>&mdash;And so Niccol&ograve; fled with his pockets full
of money.&rdquo;&nbsp; I spare the reader reflections on the
history of many bankers in <!-- page 19--><a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>Florence and
Rome, who during the past two years followed his example.</p>
<p>What is extremely interesting and original in this legend is
the declaration that Niccol&ograve; took the idea of the long and
very singular points on the lanterns from an onion.&nbsp; It
recalls the story of the acanthus leaf and the basket which
suggested the Ionic capital.&nbsp; It was understood by the
narrator that the old man who gave &ldquo;the tips&rdquo; to
Niccol&ograve; was a wizard.</p>
<p>There was much more meaning attached to the lanterns and
rings, such as Niccol&ograve; made, than is generally known, as
appears by the following extract:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Among the striking features of the
Florentine palaces are the handsome ornaments of bronze or
wrought-iron which adorn the fa&ccedil;ades of many of
them.&nbsp; These were called <i>fanali</i> or
<i>lumi&egrave;re</i>, and were not, as one would naturally
suppose, ornaments that a man might place on his house according
to his individual taste, but they were the visible testimony of
the public recognition of great deeds.&nbsp; On festive
occasions, these <i>fanali</i> were provided with great pitch
torches, whose crackling flames gave a merry aspect to the whole
neighbourhood.&nbsp; Amerigo Vespucci addressed the account of
one of his voyages to the Gonfaloniere Piero Soderini, with whom
he had formerly been on intimate terms, and the latter procured a
decree of the Republic, in accordance with which <i>fanali</i>
were sent to the family palace of the Vespucci, and kept burning
day and night for three days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most beautiful of all the Florentine <i>fanali</i>
. . . are those which adorn the corners of the famous Strozzi
Palace.&nbsp; They are of wrought-iron, and were made by a smith
who enjoyed a local celebrity, not only on account of his
masterly work, but also because he carried on his business on a
strictly cash basis; nay, went further, and refused to work for
any one who did not prepay, in part at least, for his
order.&nbsp; Thus he received the name of <i>Caparra</i>, or
Earnest-money.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Florentine Life</i>, by W. B.
Scaife, p. 58.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is one thing in this legend which alone would seem to
guarantee its being an authentic or old tradition.&nbsp; <!--
page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>In it Niccol&ograve; appears as a man who is eminently
grasping, and who takes care to get his money in advance.&nbsp;
And he was in reality so noted for this, that, as Scaife
declares, he went further than dealing on a cash basis&mdash;and
so got the nickname of Caparra, or the Pledge&mdash;so well did
he know the value of cash.&nbsp; <i>Il martel d&rsquo;argento
rompe le porte di ferro</i>, or&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A hammer of silver, as we see,<br />
Breaks the iron gates of poverty.&rdquo;</p>

21</span>THE GOBLIN OF LA VIA DEL CORNO</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh for one blast of that dread horn,<br />
On Fontarabian echoes borne,<br />
When Roland brave and Olivier,<br />
And every paladin and peer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At Roncesvalles died.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Walter
Scott</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Korrigan who ever wears a horn.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Via del Corno is a narrow street passing from the Via del
Leone.&nbsp; I have found the following story in reference to the
origin of its name, which, if not authentic, is at least amusing
and original:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">La Via del
Corno</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was in what is now known as the Via del Corno an
ancient palace, which a long time ago was inhabited only by a
certain gentleman and a goblin. <a name="citation21"></a><a
href="#footnote21" class="citation">[21]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor had he any servants, because of all who came, none
remained more than one day for fear of the <i>folletto</i>.&nbsp;
And as this spread far and wide, people kept away from the Via
del Corno after dark; but as this also kept away thieves, and the
goblin did all the house-work, the master was all the better
pleased.&nbsp; Only on one point did the two differ, and that was
the point of morality.&nbsp; Here the goblin was extremely
strict, and drew the line distinctly.&nbsp; Several times, as was
the custom in those wicked days, the Signore attempted to
introduce a lady-friend to the palazzo, but the goblin all night
long, when not busied in pulling the sheets from the fair sinner,
was industriously occupied in strewing nettles or burrs under
her, or tickling the soles of her feet with a pen; and then anon,
<!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>when, sinking to sleep, she hoped for some remission of
the tease, he would begin to play interminable airs on a
horn.&nbsp; It is true that he played beautifully, like no
earthly musician, but even enchanting airs may be annoying when
they prevent sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor did the lord fare the better, even when, inspired
by higher motives, he &lsquo;would a-wooing go.&rsquo;&nbsp; For
one lady or another had heard of the goblin, and when they had
not, it always happened that by some mysterious means or other
the match was broken off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meantime the life led by the Signore was rather
peculiar, as he slept nearly all day, sallied forth for an hour
or two to exercise, go to a barber&rsquo;s, make his small
purchases, or hear the news, supped at a <i>trattoria</i>, and
then returning home, sat all night listening to the goblin as he
played divinely on the horn, or blew it himself, which he did
extremely well, toped and hob-nobbed with his familiar, who was a
great critic of wine, and, as the proverb says, &lsquo;<i>Buon
vino fiaba lunga</i>&mdash;Good wine, long
tales&rsquo;&mdash;they told one another no end of merry and
marvellous stories; and as <i>il vin fa cantare</i>, it makes man
sing, they also sang duets, solos, and glees.&nbsp; And when the
weather was ill, or chilly, or rainy, or too hot, they cured it
with Chianti, according to a medical prescription laid down in
sundry rare old works:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Nebbia, nebbia, mattutina,<br />
Che ti levi la mattina?<br />
Questa tazza di buon vino,<br />
Fatta d&rsquo;una marzamina,<br />
Contra te sia medecina!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cloudy sky i&rsquo; the morning early,<br />
What will make you vanish fairly?<br />
Ah! this goblet of good wine,<br />
Essence of the blessed vine,<br />
Shall be for thee a medicine!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Then they played chess, cards, cribbage, drole,
&eacute;cart&eacute;, Pope Joan, bo, brag, casino, thirty-one,
put, snip-snap-snorem, lift-em-up, tear-the-rag, smoke,
blind-hookey, bless-your-grand-mother, Polish-bank, seven-up,
beggar-my-neighbour, patience, old-maid, fright, baccarat,
<i>belle-en-chemise</i>, bang-up, howling-Moses, bluff,
swindle-Dick, go-it-rags, ombre or keep-dark, morelles, go-bang,
goose, dominoes, loto, <i>morra</i> or push-pin.&nbsp; And when
extra hands were wanted they came, but all that came were only
fairy hands, short at the wrist, the goblin <!-- page 23--><a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>remarking
that it saved wine not to have mouths, <i>et cetera</i>.&nbsp;
Then they had long and curious and exceedingly weighty debates as
to the laws of the games and fair play, not forgetting meanwhile
to sample all the various wines ever sung by Redi. <a
name="citation23"></a><a href="#footnote23"
class="citation">[23]</a>&nbsp; So they got on, the Signore
realising that one near friend is worth a hundred distant
relations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now it befell one night that the goblin, having seen
the Signore take off a pint of good old strong Barolo very neatly
and carefully, without taking breath or winking, exclaimed with a
long, deep sigh:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thou art a gallant fellow, a right true boon
companion, and it grieves me to the heart to think that thou art
doomed to be drowned to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh you be&mdash;doctored!&rsquo; replied the
Signore.&nbsp; &lsquo;There isn&rsquo;t water enough in the Arno
now to drown a duck, unless she held her head under in a
half-pint puddle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The goblin went to the window, took a look at the
stars, whistled and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As I expected, it is written that you are to be
drowned to-morrow, unless you carry this horn of mine hung to
your neck all day.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Quando ti trovi nel pericolo,<br />
Suona questo corno piccolo,<br />
E tu sarai salvato,<br />
Non sarai affogato!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If thou find&rsquo;st thyself forlorn,<br />
Blow aloud this little horn,<br />
And thou wilt be safe and sound,<br />
For with it thou&rsquo;lt not be drowned.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Saying this, he solemnly handed the horn to the
cavalier, drank off a goblet of muscato, wiped his lips, bowed a
ceremonious good-night, and, as was his wont, vanished with
dignity up the chimney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gentleman was more troubled by this prediction than
he liked to admit.&nbsp; I need not say that the next day he did
not go near the Arno, though it was as dry as a bone; nay, he
kept out of a bath, and was almost afraid to wash his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last he got the fancy that some enemies or villains
would burst into his lonely house, bind him hand and foot carry
him far away, and drown him in some lonely stream, or <!-- page
24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>perhaps in the sea.&nbsp; He remembered just such a
case.&nbsp; We all remember just such cases when we don&rsquo;t
want to.&nbsp; That was it, decidedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he had a happy thought.&nbsp; There was a little
hiding-chamber, centuries old, in the palazzo, known only to
himself, with a concealed door.&nbsp; He would go and hide
there.&nbsp; He shouted for joy, and when he entered the room, he
leaped with a great bound from the threshold of the door, down
and over three or four steps, into the middle of the little
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now he did not know that in the <i>cantina</i> or
cellar below this hiding-place there was an immense <i>tino</i>,
or vat, containing hundreds of barrels of wine, such as are used
to hold the rough wine ere it is drawn off and
&lsquo;made;&rsquo; nor that the floor was extremely decayed, so
that when he came down on it with a bounce, it gave way, and he
found himself in the cellar over head and ears in wine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, truly, for a minute he deemed that he was drowning
in earnest.&nbsp; And the sides of the vat were so high that he
could not climb out.&nbsp; But while swimming and struggling for
life, he caught between his thumb and finger at a nail in the
side, and to this he held, crying as loud as he could shout for
aid.&nbsp; But no one came, and he was just beginning to despair,
when he thought of the horn!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It still hung from his neck, and pouring out the wine,
he blew on it, and there came forth such a tremendous, appalling,
and unearthly blast as he of himself could never have
blown.&nbsp; It rang far and wide all over Florence, it was heard
beyond Fiesole, it wakened the dead in old Etrurian graves, for
an instant, to think they had been called by Tinia to meet the
eleven gods; it caused all the <i>folletti</i>, <i>fate</i>,
<i>diavoli</i>, <i>strege</i>, and <i>maliardi</i> to stop for an
instant their deviltries or delights.&nbsp; For it was the Great
Blast of the Horn of the Fairies, which only plays second fiddle
to the last trump. <a name="citation24"></a><a href="#footnote24"
class="citation">[24]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;And at that sound all Florence came running to see what
was the matter.&nbsp; The Grand Duke and his household came; the
Council of the Eight burst their bonds, and left the Palazzo
Vecchio; everybody came, and they fished out the Signore, and
listened with awe to his tale.&nbsp; The priests said that the
goblin was San Zenobio, the more liberal swore it was Crescenzio,
the people held to plain San Antonino.&nbsp; The Signore became a
great man.</p>
<p><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;My son,&rsquo; said the goblin to him in
confidence the following evening, &lsquo;as they sat over their
wine,&rsquo; (here I follow the text of Maddalena), &lsquo;this
is our last night together.&nbsp; Thou art saved, and I have
fulfilled my duty to thee.&nbsp; Once I, too, was a man like
thee, and in that life thou didst save mine by rescuing me from
assassins.&nbsp; And I swore to watch over thee in every peril,
and bring thee to a happy end.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Il momenta e arrivato;<br />
Addio, Via del Corno!<br />
Addio, palazzo, addio!<br />
Addio, padrone, nel altro mondo!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The final hour has come for me;<br />
Street of the Horn, farewell to thee!<br />
Farewell, O palace, farewell, O street!<br />
My lord, in another world we&rsquo;ll meet.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Then the goblin told the Signore that he would ere long
contract a happy marriage, and that it was for this that he had
hitherto kept him from forming alliances which would have
prevented it; and that if in future he should ever be in great
need of assistance, to sound the horn, and he would come to him,
but that this must always be in the palace alone after
midnight.&nbsp; And having said this he vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Signore grieved for a long time at the loss of his
goblin friend, but he married happily, as had been predicted, and
his life was long and prosperous.&nbsp; So he put the horn in his
shield, and you may see it to this day on the Church of Santa
Maria Novella.&nbsp; And so it was that the Via del Corno got its
name.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;From which we may learn,&rdquo; saith Flaxius,
&ldquo;that wherever a man is appointed to be on a certain day,
there will the man be found.&nbsp; Therefore do thou, O reader,
so manage it that wherever thou art appointed to be, thou canst
<i>get well out of it</i>.&nbsp; For even Fate smiles when it
desires to do so.&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Among the monks of Santa Maria Novella in ancient days was one
known as Frate Giocondo, who was truly of the kind who are of
little use at home, or at any steady or reputable calling, but
who was profitable enough when scouring the country on the loose,
blarneying and begging from the good wives, giving counsel to the
peasants, and profitable advice, while he ate their chickens and
drank their wine, chucking all the pretty girls under their
chins, or <i>sub silentio</i>, and making himself sociable,
edifying, amusing, or holy&mdash;according to
circumstances.&nbsp; Of whom it could be truly said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Monaco in convento<br />
Non vale niente,<br />
Ma fuori vale venti.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monk in monastery<br />
Is not worth a cherry;<br />
But abroad when sent, he<br />
Often is worth twenty.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a preaching friar of Saint Dominic, truly Brother Giocondo
was not a success, but as a beggar he beat <!-- page 27--><a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>all the
Zoccoloni out of Rome, <a name="citation27"></a><a
href="#footnote27" class="citation">[27]</a> and that is saying a
great deal.&nbsp; For there never was a friar with such an oiled
and honeyed tongue, with which he could flatter and wheedle, tell
legends of the saints, witches, or goblins by the hour, give all
the gossip going; nor was he above selling his collections, or
trading donkeys, or taking a hand at a game of cards, or singing
to a lute, or even fiddling to a dance&mdash;so that, being a
great, burly, handsome, merry-eyed knave, he got on marvellously
well in the world, his jests being reported even in Siena.</p>
<p>Now one evening he was returning home to Santa Maria Novella
<i>dalla cercha</i>, &ldquo;from the quest,&rdquo; and found
himself still a few miles from Florence.&nbsp; And good fortune
had favoured him marvellously that day, for his ass bore two
panniers which were <i>ben carichi d&rsquo;ogni sorta di grazia
di Dio</i>&mdash;&ldquo;stuffed full with all sorts of mercies of
God,&rdquo; such as bags of wheat, maize, wheat-meal, chickens,
oil, cheese, butter, wine, truffles, onions, geese, turnips,
sausages, bread, ducks; in short, Signore, as I said, there was
<i>ogni sorta di grazia di Dio</i>, and enough to support a poor
family for a month.</p>
<p>Now, darkness coming on, and rain falling, the Friar stopped
at a lonely house, where he neither knew the people nor was known
to them, and begged for a night&rsquo;s lodging.&nbsp; The master
of the place was a well-to-do person, but a great knave, and no
sooner had he perceived that the monk had such a plentiful stock
of provisions, than he saw his way to give all his neighbours a
splendid feast at no expense to himself, at which he could not
fail to relieve some of his guests of their money.</p>
<p>Now this rogue had a daughter who was <i>scaltra e bene
affilata</i>&mdash;shrewd and sharp as a razor, one who could
teach cats to see in the dark, and who had grown to villainy from
her babyhood, even as a reed shoots upwards.&nbsp; <!-- page
28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>And
she only caught a wink from her good father, which glanced off on
to the load of the friar&rsquo;s donkey, to understand the whole
game, and what was expected of her.</p>
<p>You must know, Signore Carlo, that the wench was very
good-looking&mdash;bad wine in a silver cup, pretty to look at,
but vile to sup&mdash;and had all the sweet, innocent, simple
look of a saint, and she made up to Frate Giocondo like a kitten
to a child, which he took in no wise amiss, being used to such
conquests.&nbsp; And who so flattering and fawning as they all
were on Brother Giocondo; how they laughed at his jests, and
seemed to be in the last agonies of delight; but winked at one
another withal, for there were six lusty brothers or cousins in
the family, who, in case of need, did the heavy dragging out, or
advanced the last argument with clubs.</p>
<p>By-and-by, as the night wore on, the black-eyed baggage stole
away and hid herself in the room allotted to the Friar, though
with no intention to break the seventh&mdash;but that against
stealing&mdash;as you will see.&nbsp; For when the good Giocondo
went to bed, which he did in full dress, he knew not that she was
there.&nbsp; And as soon as he began to snore, she tapped gently
on the wall three times, and then went and laid herself down
softly by the Friar, who did not awake.&nbsp; At which all the
band came bursting in with torches and staves, and began to beat
the victim, reviling and cursing him for having deluded the poor
child, so that there was a fearful <i>fracasso</i>&mdash;a great
riot&mdash;but they left the door open, through which the pious
Giocondo bolted, and none pursued, as they had already secured
his provisions.</p>
<p>Now Giocondo shrewdly noted this, and at once understood that
he had been as shrewdly robbed, and that by such a trick as left
no door open to return and claim his property.&nbsp; So he
quietly mounted his ass and rode away, and returning to the
convent, thought it all over, till he <!-- page 29--><a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>came to a
device to revenge himself.&nbsp; For he was one of those who was
never bit by a wolf but what he had his skin.</p>
<p>So he let a long time pass by, and then went to work.&nbsp;
First of all he got two jars, and paid a contadino to catch for
him as many living vipers as would fill them both, saying it was
for the apothecary of his convent to make <i>teriaca</i> or
Venetian treacle, which is a cure for serpents&rsquo;
bites.&nbsp; And then he disguised himself like a lord&rsquo;s
messenger, darkening his face, and putting on long curling locks,
with a bold impudent air, with cloak and feather, sword and
dagger; truly no one would ever have known him.&nbsp; And in this
guise he went again to the <i>Albergo de&rsquo; Ladri</i>, or
Thieves&rsquo; Den, asking once more for lodging, which was
cheerfully granted.</p>
<p>Now the part which he played, and that to perfection, was that
of a foolish gasconading servant; nor had he been long in the
house ere he informed his host in confidence that he served a
great lord who was in love with a married lady in Florence, and
to win her good graces had sent her two jars full of honey or
conserves, but that there was in each a hundred crowns in gold,
of which he was to privately inform the lady, lest her husband
should suspect the truth; adding artfully, &ldquo;But i&rsquo;
faith, if I were to steal the whole myself and run away, my lord
would never pursue me, so fearful is he lest the thing should be
found out; and even if I were to be robbed, one could do
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as he said this he saw the knave give a wink to his
daughter, and knew very well what it meant, but pretended to take
no notice of it.&nbsp; So all went as before, and the girl stole
into his room and hid herself.&nbsp; But he, who was prepared for
everything, when he retired took from his pocket two or three
large screws and a screwdriver, and closed the great strong door
so that it would resist a hard assault, and left the window open
so that he could easily escape, and so went to bed.</p>
<p><!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>Then the girl, when she thought he was asleep, gave the
signal, and the thieves tried to burst in, but could not.&nbsp;
And Friar Giocondo, jumping up, gave the girl such a beating as
she had never heard of, abusing her all the time as a song to the
accompaniment of the thrashing, till at last, when he saw they
were really coming in, he jumped through the window, ran to the
stable, and finding there a fine horse, saddled it in haste and
rode away like the wind.</p>
<p>The thieves were so intent on the jars that they paid no heed
to anything else, not even to the girl, who was raging mad at her
father for having exposed her to such danger.&nbsp; So they got
two deep plates, and opened both jars at once to pour the honey
out, when lo! there came swarming forth the vipers, hissing, and
squirming, and darting out their tongues like so many
devils.&nbsp; At which sight they all fled in fear, the girl
first, nor did she stop till she got to Fiesole, where, in great
terror, she (fearing for her soul) told the whole story to
everybody and the monks.</p>
<p>The thief went to the stable, but found his horse gone, and so
had to content himself with Giocondo&rsquo;s donkey, on which,
fearing the pursuit of justice, he rode away, to be hanged
somewhere else.&nbsp; And the Abbot of Santa Maria Novella
cheerfully absolved Brother Giocondo for stealing the
horse&mdash;and accepted it as a graceful gift, or in recompense
for the load of provisions which had been lost.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thus &rsquo;twas with all of them it
sped,<br />
And the Abbot came out one horse ahead!&rdquo;</p>

31</span>THE LEGEND OF THE CROCE AL TREBBIO</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The bell in the Bargello called the
Montanara obtained the name of the <i>Campana delle Arme</i>
because it was the signal for citizens to lay aside their weapons
and retire home.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Hare&rsquo;s</i>

<p>&ldquo;Where towers are crushed, and temples fair unfold<br />

A votive column.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Wordsworth</i>, &ldquo;<i>Pillar
of Trajan</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very near to the Church of Santa Maria Novella is the small
piazza or open place of the <i>Croce al Trebbio</i>.&nbsp; This
is a column with a crucifix, the whole being of beautiful
proportions and of a strikingly romantic character.&nbsp; It is
said to have been raised to commemorate a victory of &ldquo;that
sanguinary fanatic Saint Peter Martyr&rdquo; over the
Paterini.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Croce al Trebbio,&rdquo; says Leader
Scott, &ldquo;of the year 1244, is a work of the Pisan school,
but whether it is by Niccol&ograve; or Giovanni Pisani, who were
in Florence about that epoch, there is nothing to show.&nbsp;
There was <a name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31"
class="citation">[31]</a> a curious Latin inscription in Gothic
letters, which began: <i>Sanctus Ambrosius cum Sancto Zenobio
propter grande mysterium hanc crucem</i>&mdash;and went on to say
that it was <i>reconstructed</i> by the bishops of Florence and
of Aquileia in August 1308.&nbsp; It is evident that the
connection of the cross with Saint Peter Martyr is mere
conjecture, the Italian authorities say <i>che si crede</i>,
&lsquo;<i>believed</i>&rsquo; to be erected on the spot where a
victory was gained over the Paterini.&nbsp; If this were so,
where is the mystery referred to in the inscription?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The legend, which was after long inquiry recovered by my
collector, distinctly describes the <i>reconstruction</i> of the
<!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>cross, and as certainly sets forth a <i>mysterium
magnum</i> with an apparition of the Virgin on this very spot,
which would have assuredly caused a pillar, if not a church, to
be erected in the thirteenth century.&nbsp; The story of this
mystery is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">La Croce al
Trebeio</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where the <i>Croce al Trebbio</i> now stands, was in
very old times a great palace occupied by one of the most ancient
families of Florence.&nbsp; And when it died out, there came into
the house three families, but none could remain there, being so
terrified with fearful sounds and an apparition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the custom in those days in Florence to ring a
bell at ten o&rsquo;clock at night, which was a signal for every
citizen to go home at once; therefore, after that hour no one was
seen in the streets except police guards, military patrols, and
riotous young men, whom the former aimed at arresting.&nbsp; It
often happened that such irregular folk took refuge in the old
palazzo, but if they remained there one night, they had enough of
it, and never returned, so great was the horror which they were
sure to feel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first occurrence which gave the place a bad name
was as follows: Some time after the death of the last of the old
line of Signori who had occupied the palace, and the three
families spoken of had come into it, on the first night at
midnight they heard some one put a key in the house-door, open
the same with great noise, and come storming and swearing up the
stairs into the great dining-hall.&nbsp; Then there entered a
tall and magnificently dressed gentleman, of very handsome and
distinguished appearance, but his face was deadly pale, his eyes
had a terrible gleam, and it seemed as if a light bluish flame
flickered and crept about him, ever rising and vanishing like
small serpents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And entering, he began to scold and blaspheme in a
diabolical manner, as if at servants whom he was accustomed to
have promptly at his call, saying, &lsquo;<i>Birbanti di
servitori</i>&mdash;you scoundrelly waiters&mdash;you have not
got supper ready for me, nor laid the tables.&rsquo;&nbsp; Saying
this, he seized on plates and glasses, and dashing them down
violently, broke them in mad rage.&nbsp; Then he entered the best
bedroom in the house, where some one lay asleep, and this man he
maltreated and hurled forth, saying that the bed was his own.</p>
<p><!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>&ldquo;And if after that any one dared to sleep in the
old palazzo, he was found there dead in the morning, or else
lived but a few days.&nbsp; So it came to pass that no one would
inhabit it; nay, all the houses round about began to be deserted,
and the whole neighbourhood regarded it as a pest.&nbsp; And from
all this they were relieved by a marvellously strange occurrence
and a great miracle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a gentleman who was very pious, honourable,
and brave, a good man at every point, but wretchedly poor, so
that he with his eight children and wife had all been turned into
the street, because he could not pay his rent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then in his distress he went to the city council and
begged for some kind of relief or employment; and they being much
concerned at the time about the haunted palazzo, knowing him to
be a man who would face the devil, with little to fear on account
of his integrity, proposed to him to occupy the building, adding
that he and his family should every day be supplied with food and
wine gratis, and that if, as was generally supposed, there was
hidden treasure in the palace, and he could find it, he should be
welcome to keep it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To which this brave man willingly assented, and at once
went his way to the haunted palace.&nbsp; But while on the road
he obtained olive sprigs, salt, and frankincense, also certain
images of saints, and then with much holy water sprinkled all the
rooms, stairs, and cellars, praying withal. <a
name="citation33"></a><a href="#footnote33"
class="citation">[33]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;And the first night there was again heard the grating
of the key in the lock, the crash of the door, the rapid heavy
footfall, and the spirit appeared with the waving plume of flame
on his splendid <i>beretta</i> or cap, when suddenly he was
checked and could go no farther, because the hall had been
blessed, yes, and thoroughly.&nbsp; Then the spectre began to
bellow and roar, and utter whistling screams and all horrible
sounds, worse than a wild beast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the new master of the house did not let fear
overcome him in the least, and the next day he renewed the
sprinkling and blessing, and finding there was a chapel in the
palace, he called in a priest, who there read a mass for the soul
of the ghost, so that he might rest in peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now there was a beautiful little garden attached to the
<!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>palace, and the children of the new tenant were
delighted to play in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in the middle of the garden they found a cross with
a Christ on it, and the cross had been shattered.&nbsp; But the
children took the pieces and carried them one by one into the
chamber where no one dared to sleep, and there they put them
piously together, and dressed a little altar before it, and began
to sing hymns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But while they were thus singing in their simple
devotion, wishing to aid their father, there was a knock at the
door, and a lady entered whose face was concealed in a veil, but
who seemed to be weeping as she beheld them, and she said,
&lsquo;Children, keep ever as you are; always be good and love
God, and He will love you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she continued, &lsquo;The master of this house was
a gambler and a blasphemer; when he lost money at gambling he
would return home and beat this image of Christ, till one night,
being in a mad rage, he broke it and threw it into the
garden.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But soon after that he fell ill, and knowing
that he was dying, he buried all his treasure in the
garden.&nbsp; Love God, and you shall find it.&nbsp; So he died,
blaspheming and condemned.&nbsp; Love God, and He will love
you!&rsquo;&nbsp; And saying this, she vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The children, all astonished, ran to their father and
mother, and told them that a beautiful lady had visited them, and
what she had said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they said to the children, &lsquo;You must indeed
be always good, for that Lady who spoke to you was the Holy
Virgin, who will always protect you.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then the
father called in a priest to say midnight mass at the time when
the spirit would appear.&nbsp; And he came, and said, &lsquo;I am
he who broke the cross, and for that I was damned!&rsquo;&nbsp;
Then the priest began to sprinkle holy water, with exorcisms,
when all at once the accursed one disappeared in a tremendous,
over-whelming crash of thunder, and the whole palace fell to
gravel and dust&mdash;there was not left one stone standing on
the other, save the cross which the children had repaired, which
rose alone in the middle of the garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the next day the good man dug away the rubbish by
the cross, and when this was removed, they found a mass of
charcoal, and under this the treasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the Signore, grown rich, had, to commemorate this,
<!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>a beautiful column built, on which he placed the cross,
and this is known to this day as the Croce al Trebbio, or the
Crucifix of the Cross-roads.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>If the Croce al Trebbio really commemorates one of the most
iniquitous massacres which ever disgraced even the Church, then
to find this tender and graceful little tale springing up from
it, reminds me of what I once heard of a violet which was found
growing in the Far West, and blooming in an Indian&rsquo;s
skull.&nbsp; The conception of the children playing at
worshipping, and yet half-worshipping, is very Italian.&nbsp; I
have seen little boys and girls thus rig up a small chapel in the
streets of Rome, and go through the mass and other ceremonies
with intense interest.</p>
<p>It may also be observed that in this, as in many other
legends, charcoal is found over a hidden treasure.&nbsp; The
folk-lore of coal in connection with money is so extensive and
varied, that one could write on it a small book.&nbsp; I believe
that the two are synonyms in all canting jargons or
&ldquo;slanguages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hence probably came,&rdquo; remarks Flaxius, &ldquo;the
saying, &lsquo;To haul one over the coals,&rsquo; meaning to go
over money-accounts with any one who has cause to dread the
ordeal.&nbsp; Truly &rsquo;tis but a conjecture, yet I remember
that in my youth it was generally applied to such
investigations.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And so &rsquo;twas held in early
Christian time<br />
That glowing coals were a sure test of truth<br />
And holy innocence, as was full proved<br />
By Santa Agnatesis of the Franks,<br />
And fair Lupita of the Irish isle.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since writing the foregoing I have found the whole of the
ancient inscription of the cross, as it was preserved by two
chroniclers.&nbsp; This will be found in another chapter.</p>

36</span>THE TWO FAIRIES OF THE WELL<br />
<span class="smcap">a legend of the via calzaioli</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When looking down into a well,<br />
You&rsquo;ll see a fairy, so they tell,<br />
Although she constantly appears<br />
With your own face instead of hers;<br />
And if you cry aloud, you&rsquo;ll hear<br />
Her voice in the ringing echo clear;<br />
Thus every one unto himself<br />
May be a fairy, or an elf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And truly those nymphs and fairies who inhabit wells,
or are found in springs and fountains, can predict or know what
is to take place, as may be read in Pausanias, and this power
they derive from their <i>habitat</i>, or, as Creuzer declares
(<i>Symbolik</i>, part iv. 72), they are called Muses, inasmuch
as they dwell in Hippocrene and Aganippe, the inspiring springs
of the Muses.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>On the Mysteries of
Water</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Friedrich</span>
(<i>Symbolik</i>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Long after Christianity had come in, there were many places in
the vast edifice of society whence the old heathen deities
refused to go out, and there are even yet nooks and corners in
the mountains where they receive a kind of sorcerer&rsquo;s
worship as <i>folletti</i>.&nbsp; A trace of this lingering in a
faith outworn, in nymphs, dryads, and <i>fata</i>, is found in
the following story:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Le Due Ninfe
del Pozzo</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There once lived in Florence a young nobleman, who had
grown up putting great faith in <i>fate</i>, <i>ninfe</i>, and
similar spirits, believing that they were friendly, and brought
good fortune to those who showed them respect.&nbsp; Now there
was in his palazzo in the Via Calzaioli, at the corner of the
Condotta, a very old well or fountain, on which were ancient and
worn images, and in which there was a marvellous echo, and it was
said that two nymphs had their home in it.&nbsp; And the Signore,
<!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>believing in them, often cast into the spring wine or
flowers, uttering a prayer to them, and at table he would always
cast a little wine into water, or sprinkle water on the ground to
do them honour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day he had with him at table two friends, who
ridiculed him when he did this, and still more when he sang a
song praising nymphs and fairies, in answer to their
remarks.&nbsp; Whereupon one said to him:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Truly, I would like to see<br />
An example, if &rsquo;t may be,<br />
How a fairy in a fountain,<br />
Or a goblin of the mountain,<br />
Or a nymph of stream or wood,<br />
Ever did one any good;<br />
For such fays of air or river,<br />
One might wait, I ween, for ever,<br />
And if even such things be,<br />
They are devils all to me.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Then the young Signore, being somewhat angered,
replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In the wood and by the stream,<br />
Not in reverie or dream,<br />
Where the ancient oak-trees blow,<br />
And the murmuring torrents flow,<br />
Men whose wisdom none condemn<br />
Oft have met and talked with them.<br />
Demons for you they may be,<br />
But are angels unto me.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To which his friend sang in reply, laughing:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Only prove that they exist,<br />
And we will no more resist;<br />
Let them come before we go,<br />
With <i>ha</i>!<i> ha</i>!<i> ha</i>! and <i>ho</i>!<i>
ho</i>!<i> ho</i>!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And as they sang this, they heard a peal of silvery
laughter without, or, as it seemed, actually singing in the hall
and making a chorus with their voices.&nbsp; And at the instant a
servant came and said that two very beautiful ladies were
without, who begged the young Signore to come to them
immediately, and that it was on a matter of life and death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he rose and stepped outside, but he had hardly
crossed the threshold before the stone ceiling of the hall fell
in with a tremendous crash, and just where the young Signore had
sat was a great stone weighing many <i>quintale</i> or
hundredweights, so that it was plain that if he had not been
called away, in <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>an instant more he would have been
crushed like a fly under a hammer.&nbsp; As for his two friends,
they had broken arms and cut faces, bearing marks in memory of
the day to the end of their lives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the young Signore was without the door and looked
for the ladies, they were gone, and a little boy, who was the
only person present, declared that he had seen them, that they
were wonderfully beautiful, and that, merrily laughing, they had
jumped or gone down into the well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore it was generally believed by all who heard
the tale that it was the Fairies of the Well, or <i>Fonte</i>,
who thus saved the life of the young Signore, who from that day
honoured them more devoutly than ever; nor did his friends any
longer doubt that there are spirits of air or earth, who, when
treated with pious reverence, can confer benefits on their
worshippers.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;For there are fairies all around<br
/>
Everywhere, and elves abound<br />
Even in our homes unseen:<br />
They go wherever we have been,<br />
And often by the fireside sit,<br />
A-laughing gaily at our wit;<br />
And when the ringing echo falls<br />
Back from the ceiling or the walls,<br />
&rsquo;Tis not our voices to us thrown<br />
In a reflection, but their own;<br />
For they are near at every turn,<br />
As he who watches soon may learn.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And the young Signore, to do honour to the fairies,
because they had saved his life, put them one on either side of
his coat-of-arms, as you may see by the shield which is on the
house at the corner of the Via Calzaioli.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The authenticity of this legend, is more than doubtful,
because it exists elsewhere, as I have read it, being unable to
give my authority; but unless my memory deceives me, it goes back
to classic times, and may be found in some such work as that of
Philostratus <i>de Vita Apollonii</i> or Grosius.&nbsp; Neither
am I well assured, to judge from the source whence I had it, that
it is current among the people, though no great measure of
credulity is here required, since it may be laid down as a rule,
with <!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>rarest exception, that there is no old Roman tale of the
kind which may not be unearthed with pains and patience among old
Tuscan peasant women.&nbsp; However, the <i>shield</i> is still
on the corner of the Via Calzaioli, albeit one of the nymphs on
it has been knocked or worn away.&nbsp; Thus even <i>fates</i>
must yield in time to fate.</p>
<p>I have in a note to another legend spoken of the instinct
which seems to lead children or grown people to associate wells
with indwelling fairies, to hear a voice in the echo, and see a
face in the reflection in the still water.&nbsp; Keats has
beautifully expressed it in &ldquo;Endymion&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Some mouldered steps lead into this cool
cell<br />
Far as the slabbed margin of a well,<br />
Whose patient level peeps its crystal eye<br />
Right upward through the bushes to the sky. . . .<br />
Upon a day when thus I watched . . . behold!<br />
A wonder fair as any I have told&mdash;<br />
The same bright face I tasted in my sleep<br />
Smiling in the clear well.&nbsp; My heart did leap<br />
Through the cool depth. . . .<br />
Or &rsquo;tis the cell of Echo, where she sits<br />
And babbles thorough silence till her wits<br />
Are gone in tender madness, and anon<br />
Faints into sleep, with many a dying tone.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In which tale,&rdquo; writes the immortal Flaxius,
&ldquo;there is a pretty allegory.&nbsp; Few there are who know
why truth is said to be at the bottom of a well; but this I can
indeed declare to you.&nbsp; For as a mirror was above all things
an emblem of truth, because it shows all things exactly as they
are, so the water in a well was, as many traditions prove,
considered as a mirror, because looking into it we see our face,
which we of course most commonly see in a glass, and this disk of
shining water resembles in every way a hand-mirror.&nbsp; And for
this reason a mirror was also regarded as expressing life itself,
for which reason people so greatly fear to break them.&nbsp; So
in the Latin, <i>Velut in speculo</i>, and in the Italian,
<i>Vero come un specchio</i>&mdash;&lsquo;True as a
mirror,&rsquo; we have the same idea.&nbsp; And a poet has
written, &lsquo;Mirrored as in a well,&rsquo; and many have
re-echoed the same pretty fancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which reminds me that in the Oberpfalz or Upper
Palatinate maidens were wont to go to a well by moonlight, and if
on looking therein they saw their own faces, they believed <!--
page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>that they would soon be happily married.&nbsp; But if a
cloud darkened the moon and they saw nothing, then they would die
old maids.&nbsp; But luckiest of all was it if they fancied they
saw a man&rsquo;s face, for this would be the future husband
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now it befell that a certain youth near Heidelberg fell
into a well, or put himself there, when a certain maid whom he
loved, came and looked in, and believing that she saw the face of
her destined spouse, went away in full faith that the fairy of
the well had taken his form, and so she married him.&nbsp; Which,
if it be not true, is <i>ben trovato</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truth is always represented, be it remembered, as
holding a mirror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And note also that the hand-mirror and the well were
strangely connected in ancient times, as appears by Pausanias,
who states that before a certain temple of Ceres hung a
<i>speculum</i>, which, after it had been immersed in a
neighbouring well or spring, showed invalids by reflection
whether they would live or die.&nbsp; And with all this, the
holding a mirror to the mouth of an insensible person to tell
whether the breath was still in the body, seemed also to make it
an indicator of life.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thus in life all things do pass,<br />
As it were, in magic glass.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

41</span>THE STORY OF THE VIA DELLE SERVE SMARRITE</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We all do know the usual way<br />
In which our handmaids go astray,<br />
But in this tale the situation<br />
Has a peculiar variation;<br />
How an old wizard&mdash;strange occurrence!<br />
Deluded all the girls in Florence,<br />
(It needs no magic now to do it),<br />
And how the maidens made him rue it,<br />
For having seized on him and stripped him,<br />
They tied him up and soundly whipped him.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The author of &ldquo;The Cities of Central Italy,&rdquo;
speaking of Siena, says that &ldquo;In its heart, where its
different hill-promontories unite, is the Piazza del Campo,
lately&mdash;with the time-serving which disgraces every town in
Italy&mdash;called Vittorio Emanuele.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with the
stupidity and bad taste which seems to characterise all municipal
governments in this respect all the world over, that of Florence
has changed most of the old names of this kind, and in order to
render the confusion more complete, has put the new names just
over the old ones, with the simple addition of the word
<i>Gia</i> or &ldquo;formerly.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whence came the
legend current in the Anglo-American colony, that a newly arrived
young lady, not as yet beyond the second lesson in Ollendorff,
being asked where she lived, answered in <i>Gia</i> Street.&nbsp;
She forgot the rest of the name.</p>
<p>One of these gaping <i>gias</i> is the Via del Parlascio
<i>gia Via delle Serve Smarrite</i>, or the street of the
maidservants strayed away or gone astray.&nbsp; Now Florence is
famous for its pretty servant-girls, and if I may believe a
halfpenny work, entitled &ldquo;Seven Charming Florentine <!--
page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>Domestics,&rdquo; now before me, which is racy of the
soil&mdash;or dirt&mdash;and appears to be written from life [as
accurate portraits of all the fascinating seven are given], I
opine that the damsel of this class who had never been, I do not
say a wife, but a waif and a stray, must be a phenomenal
rarity.&nbsp; Therefore it was suggested to me that it was
formerly in very ancient times the custom to send all such stray
cattle to the pound, that is, to dwell in this street as a kind
of Ghetto.&nbsp; But the folly of this measure soon became
apparent when it was found that one might as well try to get all
the cats in Tuscany into a hand-basket, or all its flies&mdash;or
fleas&mdash;under one tumbler, as try to make a comprehensive
menagerie of these valuable animals, who were, however, by no
means curiosities.&nbsp; So the attempt was abandoned, and
thenceforth the maidens were allowed to stray wherever they
pleased, but under some slight supervision; whence it was said of
them that they were <i>le lucertole chi cominciano a sentir il
sole</i>&mdash;&ldquo;fireflies which begin to see the
sun&rdquo;&mdash;a proverb which the learned and genial Orlando
Peschetti (1618) explains as being applicable to those who,
having been in prison and then set free, are still watched, but
which appears to me rather to refer to the suspected who are
&ldquo;shadowed&rdquo; before they are arrested.</p>
<p>But in due time I received from good authority an ancient
legend of the Via delle Serve Smarrite, in which the origin of
the name is explained as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Via delle Serve
Smarrite</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was long ago, in what was afterwards called the
Via delle Serve Smarrite, or Stray Maid-Servants&rsquo; Street, a
very ancient and immensely large house, which was generally
supposed to be vacant, and in which no one cared to dwell, or
even approach, since there were dreadful tales of evil deeds done
in it, and reports that it was a gathering-place for witches,
goblins, and <i>diavoli</i>.&nbsp; The clanking of chains and
peals of horrid laughter rung from its chambers at midnight, blue
and <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>green fires gleamed from its windows, and everybody all
around had heard from somebody else that the nightmares had there
their special nest, from which they sailed forth to afflict all
Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet all this was a trick which was often played in
those days, when <i>gente non dabbene</i> or evil folk and
outlaws wanted to keep a house to themselves, and there were no
newspapers to publish every mystery.&nbsp; For there were a great
many who went in there, but few who ever came out, and these were
all young and pretty servant-maids.&nbsp; And the way it was
managed was this.&nbsp; When such girls were sent to the market
to buy provisions, they always met there or elsewhere an old
woman who pretended to be extremely pious, <a
name="citation43"></a><a href="#footnote43"
class="citation">[43]</a> who, by using many arts and making
small gifts, and above all by subtle flatteries, persuaded them
that service was only fit for <i>gentaccia</i> or the dregs of
the people, and that, beautiful and graceful as they were, they
needed only live like ladies for a little time at ease, and they
would soon be fit to marry some Signore, and that she herself
would thus maintain them, hoping they would pay her well for it
all when once married.&nbsp; And I need not say that the trick
generally succeeded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The house to which they were led was ugly and repulsive
outside, but within there were beautiful rooms of all kinds,
magnificently furnished, and the new-comers were promptly bathed,
elegantly attired, and jewelled from head to foot, and instead of
serving, had maids given them as attendants, and everything
conceivable was done to make their life as pleasant and
demoralising among themselves as possible.&nbsp; But in due time
they found out that a certain Signore was lord of the house and
of themselves, and that he gradually led them into the strangest
and most terrible orgies, and finally into witchcraft, after
which one disappeared mysteriously after the other, none knew
whither, but as there were always fresh arrivals to take their
places, nobody heeded it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, this mournful disappearance of pretty
servant-maids became at last so frequent and was so mysterious,
that it began to be much talked about.&nbsp; Now there was a
certain gentleman, a man himself of great authority and
intelligence, who had heard of these vanishments and hoped to
find out their cause.&nbsp; And one night at a very late hour,
when he was passing by the mysterious house, he heard from it now
and <!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>then sounds like groans mingled with the clanking of
chains, and saw red and blue and green lights at the windows, but
by keeping still he also distinguished the sound of music and
girls&rsquo; voices laughing and singing; and stealing near in
the darkness, and fearing no devils, he contrived to climb up to
a window, and pulling aside a curtain, peeped in, when he beheld
plainly enough a great many beautiful women in scant array, or a
real dance of witches, and being marvellously attracted by the
sight of so many charms so liberally displayed, he naturally
desired to enter the gay party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here chance favoured him beyond all hope; for on
going to the door, he found an old woman about to enter, to whom
he gave a gold piece, and begged her to tell him the true story
of the house, and whether he could enter it.&nbsp; But what was
his amazement to find in her his old foster-mother of the
country, whom he had not seen for many years, and who loved him
dearly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she, being pressed, told him the whole story of the
house, wherein she was a servant, but that she had grown deadly
tired of such evil ways, and seeing such sin as went on there,
though she was well paid, and said if he would only give her a
home, she would reveal all to justice.&nbsp; And she added that
for the present he could freely join the girls who were dancing,
as the wizard, their master, was away that night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when he entered, he was amazed at the splendour of
the rooms and the beauty of the women.&nbsp; Now among these he
found one who truly enchanted him, and entering into conversation
with her, found that she would gladly escape with him, and that
many others were inclined to leave, but dare not show it for fear
of the master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the Signore, addressing all the girls, told them
that in a few hours the guards or police would, by his orders, be
in the house, and advised them to at once seize on all the
valuables on which they could lay their hands, and pack up their
bundles and depart, and that he himself would write for every one
a free pass to let her go with the property.&nbsp; And truly he
had hardly spoken ere there began such a plundering and
pillaging, sacking and spoliation, as it would have done your
heart good to see, and which was like the taking of a rich town,
only that the marauders were all maidens.&nbsp; Here was one
rolling up silver spoons, cups, anything she could get, in a
shawl; there another filling a bag with jewellery, and a silver
ladle sticking out of her bosom or back; anon a couple of Venuses
fighting <!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>for a splendid garment, while a
superb Hebe ravished a golden goblet, and an enchanting Vesta, if
not a vestal, appropriated most appropriately a silver
lamp.&nbsp; Some pulled down the curtains, others rolled up the
costly Venetian rugs; they drank wine when they were thirsty, and
quarrelled and laughed and shrieked, as a parcel of wild
servant-girls in a mad frolic might be expected to do.&nbsp; It
was a fine sight&mdash;&lsquo;one worthy of a great artist or De
Goncourt,&rsquo; notes Flaxius.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When lo! all at once there was an awful and
simultaneous shriek as the door opened, and the
<i>Domine</i>&mdash;I mean the headmaster, wizard, or
sultan&mdash;entered, gazing like an astonished demon on the
scene before his eyes.&nbsp; In a voice of thunder he asked the
meaning of the scene, when he found himself confronted by the
intruding Signore, before whom his heart run away like water when
he recognised in him a man having very great authority, with the
police at his back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, servant-maids, however pretty they may be, are
mostly <i>contadine</i> with powerful muscles and mighty arms,
and with one accord they rushed on their late master, and soon
overpowered him.&nbsp; Then he was securely bound with silken
curtain ropes, and the new Signore, taking his place at a great
table, bade all the damsels range themselves at the sides in
solemn council, for the offender was now to be tried, condemned,
and punished too, should he be found guilty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trial was indeed one of peculiar interest, and the
testimony adduced would have made the fortune of a French
novelist, but space (if nothing else) prohibits my giving
it.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that the wizard was found guilty of
taking unto himself an undue share of pretty hand-maidens, a
great sin considering the number of gallant soldiers and other
bachelors who were thereby defrauded of their dues.&nbsp; But as
he had neither murdered nor stolen, it was decided to let him go
and carry on his games in some less Christian town, on condition
that he would divide what money he had in the house among the
poor girls whom he had so cruelly cajoled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as this last sentence was plaintively pronounced,
there was a deep and beautiful sigh uttered by all the victims,
followed by three cheers.&nbsp; The master&rsquo;s strong-box was
at once hunted up, and its contents shared, and indeed they were
so considerable that the maidens one and all soon married nobly
and lived happily.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The written story, with a pleasing instinct of Italian <!--
page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>thrift, adds that the conquering Signore purchased the
property, in fact, the whole street, at a very low figure, before
the facts became known, and gave the place the name of the <i>Via
delle Serve Smarrite</i>, as it is still called by the people,
despite its new official christening.</p>

47</span>THE BRONZE BOAR OF THE MERCATO NUOVO</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Now among the Greeks, as with the Northern
races, the boar was the special type of male generation, even as
the frog expressed that of the female sex.&nbsp; And therefore
images of the boar were set in public places that fertility might
be developed among women, for which reason they also wear, as
among the Arabs, necklaces of silver frogs.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Notes
on Symbolism</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In front of the Mercato Nuovo, built by Cosimo I., stands a
bronze copy of an ancient boar, now in the Uffizzi Gallery.&nbsp;
It was cast by Pietro Tacca, and is now a fountain.&nbsp; The
popular legend in relation to it is as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the market-place of Florence, which is called <i>Il
Porcellino</i>, because there is in it a fountain with a swine,
there was anciently only a spring of water and a pool, in which
were many frogs, water-lizards, shell-snails, and slugs.&nbsp;
These were round about, but in the spring itself was a frog who
was confined there because she had revealed that her lover was a
boar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This boar was the son of a rich lord, who, being
married for a very long time, had no children, and for this
reason made his wife very unhappy, saying that she was a useless
creature, and that if she could not bear a son she had better
pack up and be off with herself, which she endured despairingly
and weeping continually, praying to the saints and giving alms
withal, all to bring forth an heir, and all in vain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day she saw a drove of pigs go by her palace, and
among them were many sows and many more very little pigs.&nbsp;
Now among these, or at hand, was a <i>fata</i> or witch-spirit.
<a name="citation47"></a><a href="#footnote47"
class="citation">[47]</a>&nbsp; And the lady seeing this said in
the bitterness of her heart, &lsquo;So the very pigs have
offspring and I none.&nbsp; I would I were as <!-- page 48--><a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>they are, and
could do as they do, and bring forth as they bring forth, and so
escape all this suffering!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the fairy heard this, and took her at her word;
and, as you will see, she cut her cloth without measuring it
first, from which came a sad misfit.&nbsp; And soon after she was
ill, and this being told to her husband, he replied, &lsquo;Good
news, and may she soon be gone!&rsquo; but he changed his tone
when he heard that he was to have an heir.&nbsp; Then he flew to
her and begged her pardon, and made great rejoicings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly there was horror and sorrow when in due time the
lady, instead of a human child, brought forth a boar-pig.&nbsp;
Yet the parents were so possessed with the joy of having any kind
of offspring that they ended by making a great pet of the
creature, who was, however, human in his ways, and could in time
talk with grace and ease. <a name="citation48a"></a><a
href="#footnote48a" class="citation">[48a]</a>&nbsp; And when he
grew older he began to run after the girls, and they to run away
from him, screaming as if the devil had sent him for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There lived near the palace a beautiful but very poor
girl, and with her the young Boar fell desperately in love.&nbsp;
So he asked her parents for her hand; but they, poor as they
were, laughed at him, saying that their daughter should never
marry a swine.&nbsp; But the young lady had well perceived that
this was no common or lazy pig, such as never gets a ripe
pear&mdash;<i>porco pigro non mangia pere mature</i>&mdash;as he
had shown by wooing her; and, secondly, because she was poor and
ambitious, and daring enough to do anything to become rich and
great. <a name="citation48b"></a><a href="#footnote48b"
class="citation">[48b]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Now she surmised that there were eggs under the chopped
straw in this basket, or more in the youth than people supposed;
and she was quite right, for on the bridal night he not only
unclothed himself of silk and purple and fine linen, but also
doffed his very skin or boar&rsquo;s hide, and appeared as
beautiful as a Saint Sebastian freshly painted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he said to her, &lsquo;Be not astonished to find
me good-looking at the rate of thirty sous to a franc, nor deem
thyself over-paid, for if we had not wedded, truly I should have
gone on pigging it to the end of my days, having been
doomed&mdash;like many men&mdash;to be a beast so long as I was a
bachelor, or <!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>till a beautiful maid would marry
me.&nbsp; Yet there is a condition attached to this, which is,
that I can only be a man as thou seest me by night, for I must be
a boar by day.&nbsp; And shouldst thou ever betray this secret to
any one, or if it be found out, then I shall again be a boar all
the time for life, and thou turn into a frog because of too much
talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now as surely as that time and straw ripen medlars, as
the saying is, just so surely will it come to pass that a woman
will tell a secret, even to her own shame.&nbsp; And so it befell
this lady, who told it as a great mystery to her mother, who at
once imparted it under oath to all her dear friends, who swore
all their friends on all their salvations not to breathe a word
of it to anybody, who all confessed it to the priests.&nbsp; How
much farther it went God knows, but by the time the whole town
knew it, which was in one day of twenty-four hours, or ere the
next morning, the bride had become a frog who lived in the
spring, and the bridegroom a boar who every day went to drink at
the water, and when there said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Lady Frog! lo, I am here!<br />
He to whom thou once wert dear.<br />
We are in this sad condition,<br />
Not by avarice or ambition,<br />
Nor by evil or by wrong,<br />
But &rsquo;cause thou could&rsquo;st not hold thy tongue;<br />
For be she shallow, be she deep,<br />
No woman can a secret keep;<br />
Which all should think upon who see<br />
The monument which here will be.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;So it came to pass either that the boar turned into the
great bronze <i>maiale</i> which now stands in the market-place,
or else the people raised it in remembrance of the
story&mdash;<i>chi sa</i>&mdash;but there it is to this day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for the Signora Frog, she comforted herself by
making a great noise and telling the tale at the top of her
voice, having her brains in her tongue&mdash;<i>il cervello nella
lingua</i>, as they say of those who talk well yet have but small
sense.&nbsp; And that which you hear frogs croaking all night
long is nothing but this story which I have told you of their
ancestress and the bronze boar.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>This is, in one form or the other, a widely spread tale.&nbsp;
As the voice of the frog has a strange resemblance to that of
man, there being legends referring to it in every <!-- page
50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>language, and as there is a bold and forward expression
in its eyes, <a name="citation50"></a><a href="#footnote50"
class="citation">[50]</a> it was anciently regarded as a human
being who was metamorphosed for being too impudent and
loquacious, as appears by the legend of &ldquo;Latona and the
Lycian Boors&rdquo; (Ovid, <i>Metamorph.</i>, vi. 340).&nbsp; The
general resemblance of the form of a frog to that of man greatly
contributed to create such fables.</p>
<p>The classic ancient original of this boar may be seen in the
Uffizzi Gallery.&nbsp; As the small image of a pig carried by
ladies ensures that they will soon be, as the Germans say,
&ldquo;in blessed circumstances,&rdquo; or <i>enceinte</i> (which
was all one with luck in old times), so the image of the boar is
supposed to be favourable to those ladies who desire olive
branches.&nbsp; From all which it appears that in ancient times
swine were more highly honoured than at present, or, as Shelley
sings:</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We
pigs<br />
Were blest as nightingales on myrtle sprigs,<br />
Or grasshoppers that live on noon-day dew.&rdquo;</p>

E superbo di Giotto il Campanile.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Giuseppe

<p>&ldquo;Round as the O of Giotto, d&rsquo;ye see?<br />
Which means as well done as a thing can

</blockquote>
<p>Many have wondered how it came to pass that Virgil lived in
tradition not as a poet but as sorcerer.&nbsp; But the reason for
it is clear when we find that in Florence every man who ever had
a genius for anything owed it to magic, or specially to the
favour of some protecting fairy or <i>folletto</i>, spirit or
god.&nbsp; Is a girl musical?&nbsp; Giacinto or Hyacinth, the
favourite of Apollo, has given her music lessons in her
dreams.&nbsp; For the orthodox there are Catholic saints with a
specialty, from venerable Simeon, who looks after luck in
lotteries, to the ever-blessed Antony, who attends to everything,
and Saint Anna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lucina, who inspires
nurses.&nbsp; And where the saints fail, the <i>folletti</i>,
according to the witches, take their place and do the work far
better.&nbsp; Therefore, as I shall in another place set forth,
Dante and Michel Angelo have passed into the marvellous mythology
of goblins.&nbsp; With them is included Giotto, as appears by the
following legend of &ldquo;The Goblin of the Bell-Tower of
Giotto.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Il Folletto del
Campanile di Giotto</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Giotto was a shepherd, and every day when he went forth
to pasture his herd there was one little lamb who always kept
<!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>near him, and appeared to be longing to talk to him like
a Christian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now this lamb always laid down on a certain stone which
was fast in the ground (<i>masso</i>); and Giotto, who loved the
lamb, to please it, lay down also on the same stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After a short time the lamb died, and when dying
said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Giotto, cosa non far ti<br />
Se mi senti parlarti,<br />
Ti voglio tanto bene<br />
E dove andrai,<br />
Io ti seguiro sempre<br />
In forma di folletto,<br />
E col mio volere<br />
Tu verrai un bravo scultore<br />
E insegne disegnatore.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Giotto, be not astonished<br />
That I thus speak to thee;<br />
I have such love for thee,<br />
Wherever thou shalt go<br />
I will follow thee always<br />
In the form of a fairy,<br />
And through my favour<br />
Thou shalt become a great sculptor<br />
And artist.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And so it came to pass that Giotto was an able sculptor
by the aid of the lamb, and all that he did was due to the lamb
which helped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when he died, the spirit of the lamb remained in
the form of a <i>folletto</i> or fairy in the campanile, and it
is still often seen there, always with the spirit of
Giotto.&nbsp; Even in death their souls could not be
separate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When any one desires to ascend the tower, and his or
her heart fails in mounting the steps (<i>e che ha paura di
salire</i>), the fairy below says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Vade, vade, Signora!<br />
La vade su salgha,<br />
Non abbia paura,<br />
Ci sono io sotto.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Go on, go on, Signora,<br />
Go up the stairs&mdash;oh go!<br />
Be not afraid, my lady!<br />
For I am here below.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Then the visitor hearing this believes it is one of the
guides employed (<i>inpiegati</i>), or one of the gentlemen or
ladies <!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>who are ascending after.&nbsp; And
often when half-way up there comes a great puff of wind which
blows up their skirts (<i>fa gonfiare le sottane</i>) which
causes great laughter, and they think that this is only a common
thing, and do not perceive that it does not happen to others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it is said that this fairy appears by night in the
Piazza del Duomo, or Cathedral Square, in different
forms.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The reason why Giotto is so popularly known as having been a
shepherd is that on the central tablet of the tower or campanile,
facing the street, there is a bas-relief of a man seated in a
tent with sheep before him, and this is naturally supposed to
represent the builder or Giotto himself, since it fills the most
prominent place.&nbsp; In a very popular halfpenny chapbook,
entitled &ldquo;The Statues under the Uffizzi in Florence,
Octaves improvised by Giuseppe Moroni, called <i>Il Niccheri</i>
or the Illiterate,&rdquo; I find the following:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Giotto</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Voi di Mugello, nato dell&rsquo; interno,<br />
Giotto felice, la da&rsquo; Vespignano<br />
Prodigiose pitture in ogni esterno<br />
A Brescia, a Roma, Firenze e Milano,<br />
Nelle pietre, ne&rsquo; marmi nel quaderno,<br />
L&rsquo;archittetura al popolo italiano.<br />
Da non trovare paragone simile,<br />
Vi basti, per esempio, il campanile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou of Mugello, born in Italy,<br />
Happy Giotto, gav&rsquo;st to Vespignan<br />
Great pictures which on every front we see<br />
At Brescia, Rome, in Florence and Milan,<br />
In stone, in marble, and in poetry,<br />
And architecture, all Italian.<br />
Nothing surpassed thy wondrous art and power,<br />
Take for example, then, our great bell-tower.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that this is taken from a very popular halfpenny work
indicates the remarkable familiarity with such a name as that of
Giotto among the people.</p>

<p>I once begun a book&mdash;the ending and publishing of it are
in the dim and remote future, and perhaps in the limbo of all
things unfinished.&nbsp; It was or is &ldquo;The Experiences of
Flaxius the Immortal,&rdquo; a sage who dwells for ever in the
world, chiefly to observe the evolution of all things absurd,
grotesque, quaint, illogical&mdash;in short, of all that is
strictly human.&nbsp; And on him I bestowed a Florentine legend
which is perhaps of great antiquity, since there is a hint in it
of an ancient Hebrew work by Rabbi ben Mozeltoff or the learned
Gedauler Chamar&mdash;I forget which&mdash;besides being found in
poetic form in my own great work on Confucius.</p>
<p>That money is the life of man, and that treasure buried in the
earth is a sin to its possessor, forms the subject of one of
Christ&rsquo;s parables.&nbsp; The same is true of all talent
unemployed, badly directed, or not developed at all.&nbsp; The
turning-point of evolution and of progressive civilisation will
be when public opinion and state interests require that every man
shall employ what talent he has, and every mere idler be treated
as a defaulter or criminal.&nbsp; From this truly Christian point
of view the many tales of ghosts who walk in agony because of
buried gold are strangely instructive.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 55--><a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span><span
class="smcap">Flaxius and the Rose</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Midnight was ringing from the cloister of San Miniato
in Florence on the hill above, and Flaxius sat by the Arno down
below, on the bank by the square grey tower of other days, known
as the Niccol&ograve;, or <i>Torre delta Trinit&agrave;</i>,
because there are in it three arches. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was midnight in mid-winter, and a full moon poured
forth all its light over Florence as if it would fain preserve it
in amber, and over the olive groves as if they had become moss
agates. . . .</p>
<p>[&ldquo;&lsquo;Or I,&rsquo; quoth Flaxius, &lsquo;a fly in
hock.&rsquo;]</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was a clear, cold, Tuscan night, and as the
last peal of bells went out into eternity and faded in the
irrevocable, thousands of spirits of the departed began to
appear, thronging like fireflies through the streets, visiting
their ancient haunts and homes, greeting, gossiping, arranging
their affairs just as the peasants do on Friday in the great
place of the Signoria, as they have done for centuries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flaxius looked at the rolling river which went rushing
by at his feet, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Arno mio</i>, you are in a tremendous hurry
to get to the sea, and all the more so because you have just had
an <i>accessit</i>&mdash;a remittance of rain from the
mountain-banks.&nbsp; <i>Buon pro vi faccia</i>&mdash;much good
may it do you!&nbsp; So every shopman hurries to become a great
merchant when he gets some money, and every farmer a signore, and
every signore a great lord, and every great lord a ruler at court
and over all the land&mdash;<i>prorsum et sursum</i>.&nbsp; And
when they get there&mdash;or when you get to the sea&mdash;then
ye are all swallowed up in greater lives, interests, and actions,
and so the rivers run for ever on, larger yet ever seeming less
unto yourselves.&nbsp; And so&mdash;<i>ad altiora tendunt
omnes</i>&mdash;the flower-edged torrent and the
Florentine.&rsquo; . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he suddenly heard above his head a spirit voice,
clear, sweet and strange, ringing, not in words, but tones of
unearthly music&mdash;of which languages there are many among the
Unearthlies, all being wordless songs or airs suggesting speech,
and yet conveying ideas far more rapidly.&nbsp; It was the Goblin
of the Tower calling to him of the tower next beyond on the
farther hill, and he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How many ghosts there are out
to-night!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes; it is a fine night for ghosting.&nbsp;
Moonlight is mid-summer <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>for them, poor souls!&nbsp; But I
say, brother, who is yonder <i>frate</i>, the dark monk-spectre
who always haunts your tower, lingering here and there about
it?&nbsp; What is the spell upon that <i>spirito</i>?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He is one to be pitied,&rsquo; replied the
Goblin of the Trinit&agrave;.&nbsp; &lsquo;He was a good fellow
while he lived, but a little too fond of money.&nbsp; He was
afflicted with what doctors called, when I was young in Rome, the
<i>amor sceleratus habendi</i>.&nbsp; So it came to pass that he
died leaving a treasure&mdash;<i>mille aureos</i>&mdash;a
thousand gold crowns buried in my tower unknown to any one, and
for that he must walk the earth until some one living wins the
money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flaxius pricked up his ears.&nbsp; He understood all
that the spirits said, but they had no idea that the man in a
scholar&rsquo;s robe who sat below knew Goblinese.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What must a mortal do to get the gold?&rsquo;
inquired the second goblin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Truly he must do what is well-nigh
impossible,&rsquo; replied the Elf of the Tower; &lsquo;for he
must, without magic aid&mdash;note that&mdash;bring to me here in
this month of January a fresh full-blown rose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The voices were silent; a cloud passed over the face of
the moon; the river rushed and roared on; Flaxius sat in a
Vandyke-brown study, thinking how he could obtain peace and
repose for the ghostly monk, and also get the
<i>pecuniam</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Here is,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;<i>aliquid
laborare</i>&mdash;something to be worked out.&nbsp; Now is the
time, and here is a chance&mdash;<i>ingirlandarsi di
lauro</i>&mdash;to win the laurel wreath.&nbsp; A rose in
January!&nbsp; What a pity that it is not four hundred years
later, when people will have green-houses, and blue-nosed
vagabonds will be selling red roses all the winter long in the
Tornabuoni!&nbsp; Truly it is sometimes inconvenient to be in
advance of or behind the age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Eureka</i>!&nbsp; I have it,&rsquo; he at
last exclaimed, &lsquo;by the neck and tail.&nbsp; I will
<i>spogliar la tesoria</i>&mdash;rob the treasury and spoil the
Egyptian&mdash;<i>si non in errore versatus sum</i>&mdash;unless
I am stupendously mistaken.&nbsp; Monk! thy weird will soon be
dreed&mdash;thy penance prophesied will soon be
o&rsquo;er.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saying this he went into the city.&nbsp; And there the
next day, going to a fair dame of his acquaintance, who excelled
all the ladies of all Italy in ingenious needlework, he had made
of silk a rose; and so deftly was it done, that had it been put
on a bush, you would have sworn that a nightingale would have
sung to it, or bee have sought to ravish it.</p>
<p><!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>&ldquo;Then going to a Venetian perfumer&rsquo;s, the
wise Flaxius had his flower well scented with best attar of roses
from Constantinople, and when midnight struck he was at the tower
once more calling to the goblin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Che vuoi</i>?&nbsp; What dost thou
seek?&rsquo; cried the Elf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The treasure of the monk!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Bene</i>!&nbsp; Give me a rose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Ecco</i>!&nbsp; There it is,&rsquo; replied
Flaxius, extending it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Non facit</i>&mdash;it won&rsquo;t do,&rsquo;
answered the goblin (thinking Flaxius to be a monk).&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is a sham rose artificially coloured, <i>murice tincta
est</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Smell it,&rsquo; replied Flaxius calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The <i>smell</i> is all right, I admit,&rsquo;
answered the guardian of the gold.&nbsp; &lsquo;The perfume is
delicious;&rsquo; here he sniffed at it deeply, being, like all
his kind, enraptured with perfume, &lsquo;and that much of it is,
I grant, the real thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now tell me,&rsquo; inquired Flaxius,
&lsquo;truly&mdash;<i>religios&egrave; testimonium
dicere</i>&mdash;by thy great ancestress Diana and her
sister-double Herodias and her Nine Cats, by the Moon and the
eternal Shadow, Endamone, and the word which Bergoia whispered
into the ear of the Ox, and the Lamia whom thou lovest&mdash;what
is it makes a man?&nbsp; Is it his soul or his body?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Man of mystery and master of the hidden
lore,&rsquo; replied the awe-struck goblin, &lsquo;it is his
<i>soul</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And is not the perfume of the rose its
<i>soul</i>&mdash;that which breathes its life, in which it
speaks to fairies or to men?&nbsp; Is not the voice in song or
sweetened words the perfume of the spirit, ever true?&nbsp; Is
not&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I give it up,&rsquo; replied the goblin.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The priest may turn in now for a long, long nap.&nbsp;
Here, take his gold, and <i>ne gioire tutto
d&rsquo;allegrezza</i>&mdash;may you have a merry time with
it.&nbsp; There is a great deal of good drinking in a thousand
crowns; and if you ever try to <i>ludere latrunculis vel
aleis</i>, or shake the bones or dice, I promise you three
sixes.&nbsp; By the way, I&rsquo;ll just keep this rose to
remember you by.&nbsp; <i>Addio&mdash;a
rivederlei</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the bedesman slept amid his ashes cold, and the good
Flaxius, who was a stout carl for the nonce, with a broad back
and a great beard, returned, bearing a mighty sack of ancient
gold, which stood him in good stead for many a day.&nbsp; And the
goblin is still there in the tower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>H&aelig;c fabula docet</i>,&rdquo; wrote Flaxius as
he revised the proof with a red-lead pencil, for which he had
paid a penny in the Calzolaio.&nbsp; &ldquo;This tale teaches
that in this life there is naught <!-- page 58--><a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>which hath
not its ideal side or inner soul, which may raise us to higher
reflection or greater profit, if we will but seek it.&nbsp; The
lower the man the lower he looks, but it is all to his loss in
the end.&nbsp; Now every chapter in this book, O my son&mdash;or
daughter&mdash;may seem to thee only a rose of silk, yet do not
stop at that, but try to find therein a perfume.&nbsp; For thou
art thyself, I doubt not, such a rose, even if thy threads (as in
most of us) be somewhat worn, torn, or faded, yet with a soul far
better than many deem who see thee only afar off.&nbsp; And this
my book is written for the perfume, not the silk of my
reader.&nbsp; And there is no person who is better than what the
world deems him or her to be who will not find in it marvellous
comfort, solace, and satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus wrote Flaxius.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Since I penned the foregoing from memory, I have found the
Italian text or original, which had been mislaid for years.&nbsp;
In it the tale is succinctly told within the compass of forty
lines, and ends with these words:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Take the treasure, and give me the
rose!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so the spirit gave him the treasure and took the
rose, and the poor man went home enriched, and the priest to
sleep in peace&mdash;<i>fra gli eterni</i>&mdash;among the
eternals.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I ought, of course, to have given scientifically only the text
word for word, but <i>litera scripta manet</i>&mdash;what is
written remains, and Flaxius is an old friend of mine, and I
greatly desired to introduce him to my readers.&nbsp; And I doubt
not that the reviewers will tell me if I have sinned!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Do a good deed, or aught that&rsquo;s
fit,<br />
You never again may hear of it;<br />
But make a slip, all will detect it,<br />
And every friend at once correct it!&rdquo;</p>

59</span>THE GHOST OF MICHEL ANGELO</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If I believed that spirits ne&rsquo;er<br
/>
Return to earth once more,<br />
And that there&rsquo;s naught unto them dear<br />
In the life they loved before;<br />
Then truly it would seem to me,<br />
However fate has sped,<br />
For souls there&rsquo;s no eternity,<br />
And they and all are dead.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It must have struck every one who has read the life of Michel
Angelo, that he was, like King James the First of England,
&ldquo;nae great gillravager after the girls,&rdquo; or was far
from being susceptible to love&mdash;in which he formed a great
contrast to Raphael, and indeed to most of the Men of his
Time&mdash;or any other.&nbsp; This appears to have impressed the
people of Italy as something even more singular than his works,
for which reason he appears in popular tradition as a good enough
goblin, not without cheerfulness and song, but as one given to
tormenting enamoured couples and teasing lady artists, whom he
subsequently compliments with a gift.&nbsp; The legend is as
follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Lo Spirito di
Michele Angiolo Buonarotti</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The spirit of Michel Angelo is seen mostly by night, in
woods or groves.&nbsp; The good man appears as he did in life,
<i>come era prima</i>, ever walking among trees singing
poetry.&nbsp; He amuses himself very much by teasing
lovers&mdash;<i>a dare noia agli amoretti</i>&mdash;and when he
finds a pair who have hidden themselves under leaves and boughs
to make love, he waits till they think they are well concealed,
and then begins to sing.&nbsp; And the two feel a spell upon them
when they hear his voice, and can neither advance nor
retreat.</p>
<p><!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>&ldquo;Then all at once opening the leafy covert, he
bursts into a peal of laughter; and the charm being broken, they
fly in fear, because they think they are discovered, and it is
all nothing but the spirit of Michel Angelo Buonarotti.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When some lady-artist goes to sketch or paint, be it
<i>al piazzale</i>, in open places, or among the woods, it is his
delight to get behind, and cause her to blunder, scrawl, and daub
(<i>fare degli scarabocchi</i>).&nbsp; And when the artist is
angered, she will hear a loud peal of laughter; and if this
irritates her still more, she will hear a song, and yet not
perceive the singer.&nbsp; And when at last in alarm she catches
up her sketch, all scrawled and spoiled, and takes to flight, she
will hear the song following her, and yet if she turns her head
she will see no one pursuing.&nbsp; The voice and melody are
always beautiful.&nbsp; But it is marvellously lucky to have this
happen to an artist, for when she gets home and looks at her
sketch, she finds that it is neither scrawled nor daubed, but
most exquisitely executed in the style of Michel
Angelo.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It is marvellous how the teasing faun or Silvanus of the
Romans has survived in Tuscany.&nbsp; I have found him in many
forms, under many names, and this is the last.&nbsp; But why it
should be Michel Angelo, I cannot imagine, unless it be that his
face and stump nose, so familiar to the people, are indeed like
that of the faun.&nbsp; The <i>dii sylvestres</i>, with all their
endless mischief, riotry, and revelry, were good fellows, and the
concluding and rather startling touch that the great artist in
the end always bestows a valuable picture on his victim is really
godlike&mdash;in a small way.</p>
<p>It is remarkable as a coincidence, that Michel Angelo was
himself during life terribly annoyed and disturbed by people
prying and speering about him while painting&mdash;especially by
Pope Leo&mdash;for whom he nevertheless painted very good
pictures.&nbsp; It would almost seem as if there were an echo of
the event in the legend.&nbsp; Legend is the echo of history.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This legend,&rdquo; remarks Flaxius, &ldquo;may give a
valuable hint to collectors.&nbsp; Many people are aware that
there are in existence <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>great numbers of sketchings and
etchings attributed to Michel Angelo, D&uuml;rer, Raphael, Marc
Antonio, and many more, which were certainly executed long since
those brothers of the paint or pencil passed away.&nbsp; May it
not be that the departed still carry on their ancient callings by
the aid of new and marvellous processes to us as yet unknown, or
by what may be called &lsquo;pneumato-gravure&rsquo;?&nbsp; Who
knows?&mdash;&rsquo;tis a great idea, my masters;&mdash;let us
pass on or <i>legit</i> unto another legend!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well I ween it may be true<br />
That afar in fairyland<br />
Great artists still pursue<br />
That which in life they knew,<br />
And practise still, with ever bettering hand,<br />
Sculpture and painting, all that charm can bring,<br />
While by them all departed poets sing.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It has been boldly asserted by writers who should know better,
that there are no ghosts in Italy, possibly because the two only
words in the language for such beings are the equivocal ones of
<i>spirito</i> or spirit, and <i>spettro</i> or spectre&mdash;or
<i>specter</i>, as the Websterians write it&mdash;which is of
itself appalling as a terrific spell.&nbsp; But the truth is that
there is no kind of <i>spuk</i>, goblin, elf, fairy, gnome, or
ouphe known to all the North of Europe which was not at home in
Italy since old Etruscan days, and ghosts, though they do not
make themselves common, are by no means as rare as
eclipses.&nbsp; For, as may be read in my &ldquo;Etruscan Roman
Legends,&rdquo; people who will look through a stone with a hole
in it can behold no end of <i>revenants</i>, or returners, in any
churchyard, and on fine nights the seer can see them swarming in
the streets of Florence.&nbsp; Giotto is in the campanile as a
gentle ghost with the fairy lamb, and Dante, ever benevolent, is
all about town, as appears from the following, which was
unexpectedly bestowed on me:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 63--><a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span><span
class="smcap">Lo Spirito di Dante Alighieri</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When any one is passionately fond of poetry, he should
sit by night on the <i>panchina</i> <a name="citation63"></a><a
href="#footnote63" class="citation">[63]</a> in the piazza or
square of Santa Croce or in other places (<i>i.e.</i>, those
haunted by Dante), and having read his poetry, pronounce the
following:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dante, che eri<br />
La gran poeta,<br />
Siei morto, ma vero,<br />
Il tuo spirito<br />
E sempre rimasto,<br />
Sempre per nostro<br />
Nostro aiuto.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ti chiamo, ti prego!<br />
E ti scongiuro!<br />
A voler aiutarmi.<br />
Questa poesia<br />
Voglio imparare;<br />
Di pi&ugrave; ancora,<br />
Non voglio soltanto<br />
Imparar la a cantare,<br />
Ma voglio imparare<br />
Di mia testa<br />
Poter le scrivere,<br />
E cosi venire<br />

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thou Dante, who wert<br />
Such a great poet,<br />
Art dead, but thy spirit<br />
Is truly yet with us,<br />
Here and to aid us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I call thee, I pray thee,<br />
And I conjure thee!<br />
Give me assistance!<br />
I would learn perfectly<br />
All of this poetry.<br />
And yet, moreover,<br />
I would not only<br />
Learn it to sing it,<br />
But I would learn too<br />
How I may truly<br />
From my head write it,<br />
And become really<br />
An excellent poet!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And then a form of a man will approach from around the
statue (<i>da canto</i>), advancing
gently&mdash;<i>piano-piano</i>&mdash;to the <!-- page 64--><a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>causeway, and
will sit on it like any ordinary person, and begin to read the
book, and the young man who has invoked the poet will not fail to
obtain his wish.&nbsp; And the one who has come from the statue
is no other indeed than Dante himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it is said that if in any public place of resort or
inn (<i>bettola</i>) any poet sings the poems of Dante, he is
always present among those who listen, appearing as a gentleman
or poor man&mdash;<i>secondo il locale</i>&mdash;according to the
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus the spirit of Dante enters everywhere without
being seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If his poems be in the house of any person who takes no
pleasure in them, the spirit of the poet torments him in his bed
(in dreams) until the works are taken away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There is a simplicity and directness in this tradition, as
here told, which proves the faith of the narrator.&nbsp;
Washington Irving found that the good people of East Cheap had
become so familiar with Shakespearian comedy as to verily believe
that Falstaff and Prince Hal and Dame Quickly had all lived, and
still haunted the scenes of their former revels; and in like
manner the Florentine has followed the traditions of olden time
so closely and lovingly, that all the magnates of the olden time
live for him literally at the present day.&nbsp; This is in a
great measure due to the fact that statues of all the celebrities
of the past are in the most public places, and that there are
many common traditions to the effect that all statues at certain
times walk about or are animated.</p>
<p>One of the commonest halfpenny or <i>soldo</i> pamphlets to be
found on the stand of all open-air dealers in ballads&mdash;as,
for instance, in the Uffizzi&mdash;is a collection of poems on
the statues around that building, which of itself indicates the
interest in the past, and the knowledge of poets and artists
possessed by the common people.&nbsp; For the poorest of them are
not only familiar with the names, and more or less with the
works, of Orcagna, Buonarotti, Dante, Giotto, Da Vinci,
Raffaelle, Galileo, Machiavelli, <!-- page 65--><a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>and many
more, but these by their counterfeit presentments have entered
into their lives and live.&nbsp; Men who are so impressioned make
but one bold step over the border into the fairyland of faith
while the more cultured are discussing it.</p>
<p>I do not, with some writers, believe that a familiarity with a
few names of men whose statues are always before them, and from
whose works the town half lives, indicates an indescribably high
culture or more refined nature in a man, but I think it is very
natural for him to make legends on them.&nbsp; There are three
other incantations given in another chapter, the object of which,
like this to Dante, is to become a poet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From which we learn that in the fairy faith,&rdquo;
writes Flaxius, with ever-ready pen, &ldquo;that poets risen to
spirits still inspire, even in person, neophytes to song.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Life is a slate of action, and the
store<br />
Of all events is aggregated there<br />
That variegate the eternal universe;<br />
Death is a gate of dreariness and gloom,<br />
That leads to azure isles and beaming skies . . .<br />
Therefore, O spirit, fearlessly bear on.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>If we pass the Porta Romana, and keep on for three miles, we
shall arrive at the old Carthusian convent of La Certosa in Val
d&rsquo;Ema.&nbsp; Soon after passing &ldquo;the village of
Galluzzo, where the stream is crossed, we come to an ancient
gateway surmounted by a statue of Saint Laurence, <i>through
which no female could enter</i> except by permission of the
archbishop, and out which no monk could pass.&rdquo;&nbsp; At
least, it is so stated in a justly famous English guide-book,
though it does not explain how any &ldquo;female&rdquo; could
enter the saint, nor whether the female in question belonged to
the human species, or was fish, flesh, or red-herring.&nbsp; I
should, however, incline to believe the latter is meant, as
&ldquo;herring&rdquo; is a popular synonym for a loose fish.</p>
<p>The Certosa was designed and built in the old Italian Gothic
style by Andrea Orcagna, it having been founded in the middle of
the fourteenth century by Niccol&ograve; Acciajuoli, who was of a
great Florentine family, from whom a portion of the Lung Arno is
named.&nbsp; The building is on a picturesque hill, 400 feet
above the union of the brooks called the Ema and the Greve, the
whole forming <!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>a charming view of a castled
monastery of the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>There is always, among the few monks who have been allowed to
remain, an English or Irish brother, to act as cicerone to
British or American visitors, and show them the interesting tombs
in the crypt or subterranean church, and the beautiful chapels
and celebrated frescoes in the church.&nbsp; These were painted
by Poccetti, and I am told that among them there is one which
commemorates or was suggested by the following legend, which I
leave the reader to verify, not having done so myself, though I
have visited the convent, which institution is, however,
popularly more distinguished&mdash;like many other
monasteries&mdash;as a distillery of holy cordial than for aught
else:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Al Convento
della Certosa</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was in this convent a friar called Il Beato
Dyonisio, who was so holy and such a marvellous doctor of
medicine, that he was known as the Frate Miraculoso or Miraculous
Brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when any of the fraternity fell ill, this good
medico would go to them and say, &lsquo;Truly thou hast great
need of a powerful remedy, O my brother, and may it heal and
purify thy soul as well as thy body!&rsquo; <a
name="citation67"></a><a href="#footnote67"
class="citation">[67]</a>&nbsp; And it always befell that when he
had uttered this conjuration that the patient recovered; and this
was specially the case if after it they confessed their sins with
great devoutness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother Dyonisio tasted no food save bread and water;
he slept on the bare floor of his cell, in which there was no
object to be seen save a scourge with great knots; he never took
off his garments, and was always ready to attend any one taken
ill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other brothers of the convent were, however, all
jolly monks, being of the kind who wear the tunic as a tonic to
give them a better&mdash;or bitter&mdash;relish for secular
delights, holding that it is far preferable to have a great deal
of pleasure for a little penitence than <i>per poco piacer gran
penitenza</i>&mdash;much <!-- page 68--><a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>penitence for
very little pleasure.&nbsp; In short, they were just at the other
end of the rope away from Brother Dyonisio, inasmuch as they ate
chickens, <i>bistecche</i> or beef-steaks, and drank the best
wine, even on fast-days&mdash;<i>giorni di vigiglia</i>&mdash;and
slept in the best of beds; yes, living like lords, and never
bothering themselves with any kind of penance, as all friars
should do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now there was among these monks one who was a great
<i>bestemmiatore</i>, a man of evil words and wicked ways, who
had led a criminal life in the world, and only taken refuge in
the disguise of a monk in the convent to escape the hand of
justice.&nbsp; Brother Dyonisio knew all this, but said nothing;
nay, he even exorcised away a devil whom he saw was always
invisibly at the sinner&rsquo;s elbow, awaiting a chance to catch
him by the hair; but the Beato Dyonisio was too much for him, and
kept the devil ever far away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this was the way he did it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happened one evening that this <i>finto frate</i>,
or mock monk or feigned friar, took it into his head, out of pure
mischief, and because it was specially forbidden, to introduce a
<i>donna di mala vita</i>, or a girl of no holy life, into the
convent to grace a festival, and so arranged with divers other
scapegraces that the damsel should be drawn up in a basket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And sure enough there came next morning to the outer
gate a fresh and jolly black-eyed <i>contadina</i>, who asked the
mock monk whether he would give her anything in charity.&nbsp;
And the <i>finto frate</i> answering sang:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You shall have the best of meat,<br
/>
Anything you like to eat,<br />
Cutlets, macaroni, chickens,<br />
Every kind of dainty pickings.<br />
Pasticcie and fegatelli,<br />
Salam&eacute; and mortadelle,<br />
With good wine, if you are clever,<br />
For a very trifling favour!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To which the girl replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Here I am, as here you see!<br />
What would&rsquo;st thou, holy man, with me?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The friar answered:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When thou hear&rsquo;st the hoots
and howls<br />
At midnight of the dogs and owls,<br />
And when all men are sunk in sleep,<br />
And only witches watch do keep,<br />
<!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>Come &rsquo;neath the window unto me,<br />
And there thou wilt a basket see<br />
Hung by a rope as from a shelf,<br />
And in that basket stow thyself,<br />
And I alone will draw thee up,<br />
Then with us thou shalt gaily sup.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;But the girl replied, as if in fear:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But if the rope should break
away,<br />
Oh, then there&rsquo;d be the devil to pay,<br />
Oh, holy father, first for thee&mdash;<br />
But most especially for me!<br />
For if by evil luck I&rsquo;d cracked your<br />
Connecting cord, my limbs I&rsquo;d fracture!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The friar sang:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The rope is good, as it is long,<br
/>
The basket&rsquo;s tough, my arms are strong,<br />
Have thou no fear upon that score,<br />
T&rsquo;as hoisted many a maid before;<br />
For often such a basket-full<br />
Did I into a convent pull,<br />
And many more I trust will I<br />
Draw safely up before I die.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And at midnight the girl was there walking beneath the
windows awaiting the hour to rise&mdash;<i>Ascensionem
expectans</i>&mdash;truly not to heaven, nor from any great
liking for the monks, but for a great fondness for roast-chickens
and good wine, having in her mind&rsquo;s eye such a supper as
she had never before enjoyed, and something to carry home with
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So at last there was a rustling sound above, as a
window softly opened, and a great basket came vibrating down
below; and the damsel, well assured, got into it like a hen into
her nest, while the lusty friar above began to draw like an
artist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the <i>Beato frate</i> Dyonisio, knowing all that
passed round about by virtue of his holy omniscience, determined
to make manifest to the monks that things not adapted to piety
led them into the path of eternal punishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore, just as the basket-full of girl touched the
window of the convent, it happened by the virtue of the holy
Dyonisio that the rope broke and the damsel came with a <i>capi
tombola</i> somerset or first-class tumble into the street; but
as she, poor soul, had only sinned for a supper, which she
greatly needed and seldom got, she was quit for a good fright,
since no other harm happened to her.</p>
<p><!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>&ldquo;But it was far otherwise with the wicked monk,
who had only come into that holy monastery to stir up sin; for
he, leaning too far over at the instant, fell with an awful howl
to the ground, where he roared so with pain that all the other
monks came running to see what was the matter.&nbsp; And they
found him indeed, more dead than alive, terribly bruised, yet in
greater agony of mind than of body, saying that Satan had tempted
him, and that he would fain confess to the Beato Dyonisio, who
alone could save him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the good monk tended him, and so exhorted him that
he left his evil ways and became a worthy servant of God, and the
devil ceased to tempt him.&nbsp; And in due time Brother Dyonisio
died, and as a saint they interred him in the crypt under the
convent, and the morning after his burial a beautiful flower was
found growing from his tomb, and so they sainted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fall of the girl was a scandal and cause of
laughter for all Florence, so that from that day the monks never
ventured more to draw up damsels in baskets.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>This story is so widely spread in many forms, that the reader
can hardly have failed to have heard it; in fact, there are few
colleges where it has not happened that a basket has not been
used for such smuggling.&nbsp; One of the most amusing instances
is of a damsel in New Haven, or Cambridge, Massachusetts, who was
very forgetful.&nbsp; One day she said to a friend, &ldquo;You
have no idea how wicked some girls are.&nbsp; The other morning
early&mdash;I mean late at night&mdash;I was going by the college
when I saw a girl being drawn up in a basket by some students,
when all at once the rope broke&mdash;<i>and down I
came</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Germany, as in the East, the tale is told of a wooer who is
drawn up half-way in a basket and then let remain for everybody
to behold.&nbsp; In Uhland&rsquo;s Old Ballads there is one to
this effect of Heinrich Corrade der Schreiber im Korbe.&nbsp;
Tales on this theme at least need not be regarded as strictly
traditional.</p>
<p>There is another little legend attached to La Certosa which
owes its small interest to being told of a man who <!-- page
71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>was
one of the Joe Millers of Italy in the days of the Medici.&nbsp;
It is a curious fact that humorists do most abound and are most
popular in great epochs of culture.</p>
<p>Domenico Barlacchi was a <i>banditore</i>&mdash;herald or
public crier&mdash;of Florence, commonly known as Il Barlacchia,
who lived in the time of Lorenzo de&rsquo; Medici, and who, being
<i>molto piacevole e faceto</i>, or pleasing and facetious, as I
am assured by an ancient yellow jest-book of 1636 now before me,
became, like Piovano Arlotto and Gonella, one of the famous wits
of his time.&nbsp; It is worth noting, though it will be no news
to any folk-lorist, that in these flying leaves, or fleeting
collections of faceti&aelig;, there are many more indications of
familiar old Florentine life than are to be gleaned from the
formal histories which are most cited by writers who endeavour to
illustrate it.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;One morning Barlacchia, with other boon
companions, went to La Certosa, three miles distant from
Florence, <a name="citation71"></a><a href="#footnote71"
class="citation">[71]</a> where, having heard mass, they were
taken over the convent by one of the friars, who showed them the
convent and cells.&nbsp; Of which Barlacchia said &rsquo;twas all
very fine, but that he would like to see the
wine-cellar&mdash;<i>sentendosi egli hauer sete</i>&mdash;as he
felt great thirst sadly stealing over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To which the friar replied that he would gladly show
them that part of the convent, but that unfortunately the Decano
who kept the keys was absent.&nbsp; [<i>Decano</i>, dean or
deacon, may be rendered roughly in English as a dog, or literally
of a dog or currish.]&nbsp; To which Barlacchia replied,
&lsquo;Truly I am sorry for it, and I wish you were all
<i>de&rsquo; cani</i> or dogs!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Times have changed, and whether this tale brought about the
reform I cannot say, but it is certain that the good monks at
present, without waiting to be asked, generally offer a glass of
their famous cordial to visitors.&nbsp; Tastes may differ, but to
mine, when it is old, the green Certosa, though far cheaper, is
superior to Chartreuse.</p>
<p><!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>Another tale of Barlacchia, which has a certain
theological affinity with this story, is as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A great illness once befell Barlacchia, so
that it was rumoured all over Florence that he was dead, and
great was the grieving thereover.&nbsp; But having recovered, by
the grace of God, he went from his house to the palace of the
Grand Duke, who said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ha! art thou alive, Barlacchia?&nbsp; We all
heard that thou wert dead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Signore, it is true,&rsquo; was his reply.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I was indeed in the other world, but they sent me back
again, and that for a mere trifle, which you forgot to give
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what was that?&rsquo; asked the Duke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I knocked,&rsquo; resumed Barlacchia, &lsquo;at
the gate of heaven, and they asked me who I was, what I had done
in the world, and whether I had left any landed property.&nbsp;
To which I replied no, never having begged for anything.&nbsp; So
they sent me off, saying that they did not want any such poor
devils about them&mdash;<i>non volevano l&agrave; simile
dapochi</i>.&nbsp; And therefore, illustrious Signore, I make so
bold as to ask that you would kindly give me some small estate,
so that another time I may not be turned away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which so pleased the magnificent and liberal Lorenzo
that he bestowed on Barlacchia a <i>podere</i> or farm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for a long time after this illness, Barlacchia was
very pale and haggard, so that everybody who met him (and he was
well known to everybody) said, &lsquo;Barlacchia, <i>mind the
rules</i>&rsquo;&mdash;meaning the rules of health; or else,
&lsquo;Barlacchia, look to yourself;&rsquo; or <i>regolati</i>!
or <i>guardatevi</i>!&mdash;till at last he became tired with
answering them.&nbsp; So he got several small wooden rules or
rulers, such as writers use to draw lines, and hung them by a
cord to his neck, and with them a little mirror, and when any one
said &lsquo;<i>Regolati</i>&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;mind the
rules,&rsquo; he made no reply, but looked at the sticks, and
when they cried &lsquo;<i>Guardatevi</i>!&rsquo; he regarded
himself in the mirror, and so they were answered.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This agrees with the sketch of Lorenzo as given by Oscar
Browning in his admirable &ldquo;Age of the Condottieri,&rdquo; a
short history of Medi&aelig;val Italy from 1409 to 1530:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lorenzo was a bad man of business; he spent
such large sums on himself that he deserved the appellation of
the <!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>Magnificent.&nbsp; He reduced himself to poverty by his
extravagance; he alienated his fellow-citizens by his lust . . .
and was shameless in the promotion of his private
favourites.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet with all this he was popular, and left a legendary fame in
which generosity rivals a love of adventure.&nbsp; I have
collected many traditions never as yet published relating to him,
and in all he appears as a <i>bon prince</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But verily when I consider that what made a gallant
lord four hundred years ago would be looked after now by the Lord
Chancellor and the law courts with a sharp stick, I must
needs,&rdquo; writes Flaxius, &ldquo;exclaim with Spenser
sweet:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Me seemes the world is run quite out
of square,<br />
For that which all men once did Vertue call,<br />
Is now called Vice, and that which Vice was hight<br />
Is now hight Vertue, and so used of all;<br />
Right now is wrong, and wrong that was, is right,<br />
As all things else in time are changed quight.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

74</span>LEGENDS OF THE BRIDGES IN FLORENCE</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I stood upon a bridge and heard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The water rushing by,<br />
And as I thought, to every word<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The water made reply.</p>
<p>I looked into the deep river,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked so still and long,<br />
Until I saw the elfin shades<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass by in many a throng.</p>
<p>They came and went like starry dreams,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For ever moving on,<br />
As darkness takes the starry beams<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unnoted till they&rsquo;re gone.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is something in a bridge, and especially in an old one,
which has been time-worn and mossed into harmony with surrounding
nature, which has always seemed peculiarly poetical or strange to
men.&nbsp; Hence so many legends of devil&rsquo;s bridges, and it
is rather amusing when we reflect how, as Pontifex, he is thus
identified with the head of the Church.&nbsp; Thus I once, when
attending law lectures in Heidelberg in 1847, heard Professor
Mittermaier say, that those who used the saying of &ldquo;the
divine right of kings&rdquo; as an argument reminded him of the
peasants who assumed that every old bridge was built by the
devil.&nbsp; It is, however, simply the arch, which in any form
is always graceful, and the stream passing through it like a
living thing, which forms the artistic attraction or charm of
such structures.&nbsp; I have mentioned in my
&ldquo;Memoirs&rdquo; that Ralph Waldo Emerson was once impressed
by a remark, the first time I met him, to the effect that a vase
in a room had the effect of a bridge <!-- page 75--><a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>in a
landscape&mdash;at least, he recalled it at once when I met him
twenty years later.</p>
<p>The most distinguished bridge, from a legendary point of view,
in Europe, was that of Saint John Nepomuc in
Prague&mdash;recently washed away owing to stupid neglect; the
government of the city probably not supporting, like the king in
the opera-bouffe of &ldquo;Barbe Bleu,&rdquo; a commissioner of
bridges.&nbsp; The most picturesque work of the kind which I
recall is that of the Ponte Maddalena&mdash;also a devil&rsquo;s
bridge&mdash;at the Bagni di Lucca.&nbsp; That Florence is not
wanting in legends for its bridges appears from the
following:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">The Spirit of
the Ponte Vecchio or Old Bridge</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He who passes after midnight on the Ponte Vecchio can
always see a form which acts as guard, sometimes looking like a
beggar, sometimes like a <i>guardia di sicurezza</i>, or one of
the regular watchmen, and indeed appearing in many varied forms,
but generally as that of a watchman, and always leaning on the
bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if the passer-by asks him any such questions as
these: &lsquo;Chi siei?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Cosa
fai?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Dove abiti?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Ma
vien&rsquo; con me?&rsquo;&nbsp; That is: &lsquo;Who are
you?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;What dost thou
do?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Where is your
home?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Wilt with me come?&rsquo;&mdash;he
seems unable to utter anything; but if you ask him, &lsquo;Who am
I?&rsquo; it seems to delight him, and he bursts into a peal of
laughter which is marvellously loud and ringing, so that the
people in the shops waking up cry, &lsquo;There is the goblin of
the Ponte Vecchio at his jests again!&rsquo;&nbsp; For he is a
merry sprite, and then they go to sleep, feeling peaceably
assured that he will watch over them as of yore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this he really does for those who are faithful unto
him.&nbsp; And those who believe in spirits should say
sincerely:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Spirito del Ponte Vecchio,<br />
Guardami la mia bottega!<br />
Guardami dagli ladroni!<br />
Guardami anche dalla strega!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Spirit of the ancient bridge!<br />
Guard my shop and all my riches,<br />
From the thieves who prowl by night,<br />
And especially from witches!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>&ldquo;Then the goblin ever keeps guard for them.&nbsp;
And should it ever come to pass that thieves break into a shop
which he protects, he lets them work away till they are about to
leave, when he begins to scream &lsquo;<i>Al ladro</i>!<i> al
ladro</i>!&rsquo; and follows them till they are taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when the police have taken the thief, and he is
brought up to be interrogated, and there is a call for the
individual who was witness (<i>quando le guardie vanno per
interrogare l&rsquo;individuo che si e trovato presente</i>), lo
and behold he has always disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And at times, when the weather is bad, he prowls about
the bridge in the form of a cat or of a he-goat, and should any
very profane, abusive rascal (<i>bestemmiatore</i>) come along,
the spirit as a goat will go before, running nimbly, when all at
once the latter sinks into the earth, from which flames play
forth, to the great terror of the sinner, while the goblin
vanishes laughing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I have very little doubt that this guardian spirit of the
bridge is the same as Teramo, <i>i.e.</i>, Hermes Mercury, who is
believed in the Toscana Romana to betray thieves when they commit
murder.&nbsp; But Mercury was also a classic guardian of
bridges.</p>
<p>This merry goblin of the Ponte Vecchio has a colleague not far
away in the <i>Spirito del Ponte alla Carraia</i>, the legend of
which is as follows.&nbsp; And here I would note, once for all,
that in almost every case these tales were written out for me in
order to secure the greater accuracy, which did not however
always ensure it, since even Miss Roma Lister, who is to the
manor or manner born, often had with me great trouble in
deciphering the script.&nbsp; For verily it seems to be a decree
of destiny that everything traditional shall be involved, when
not in Egyptian or Himaritic, or Carthaginian or Norse-Runic, at
least in some diabolical dialect, so anxious is the Spirit of the
past to hide from man the things long passed away.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 77--><a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span><span
class="smcap">Al Ponte alla Carraia</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the Arno, or under the Bridge alla Carraia, there
lived once a certain Marocchio, <a name="citation77a"></a><a
href="#footnote77a" class="citation">[77a]</a> a
<i>bestemmiatore</i>, or blasphemer, for he cursed bitterly when
he gained but little, being truly a <i>marocchio</i>, much
attached to money.&nbsp; Even in dying he still swore.&nbsp; And
Marocchio had sold himself to the devil, and hidden his money
under a stone in the arch of the bridge.&nbsp; Yet though he had
very poor relations and friends, he confided nothing to them, and
left <i>niente a nessuno</i>, &lsquo;nothing to
nobody.&rsquo;&nbsp; Whence it came that after his death he had
no rest or peace, because his treasure remained undiscovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet where the money lay concealed there was seen every
night the form of a goat which cast forth flames, and running
along before those who passed by, suddenly sunk into the ground,
disappearing in a great flash of fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when the <i>renaioli</i> or sand-diggers, <a
name="citation77b"></a><a href="#footnote77b"
class="citation">[77b]</a> thinking it was a real goat, would
catch it by the hair, it cast forth fire, so that many of them
died of fright.&nbsp; And it often overthrew their boats and made
all the mischief possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then certain people thinking that all this indicated a
hidden treasure, sought to find it, but in vain; till at last one
who was <i>pi&ugrave; furbo</i>, or shrewder than the rest,
observed that one day, when the wind was worse than usual,
raising skirts and carrying away caps and hats, there was a goat
in all the hurly-burly, and that this animal vanished at a
certain spot.&nbsp; &lsquo;There I ween,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;lies money hid!&rsquo;&nbsp; And knowing that midnight is
the proper time or occasion (<i>cagione di nascosto tesoro</i>)
for buried hoards, he came at the hour, and finding the habitual
goat (<i>il solito chaprone</i>), he addressed him thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If thou art a blessed soul, then go thy way in
peace, and God be with thee.&nbsp; But if thou sufferest from
buried treasure, then teach me how I, without any fear, may take
thy store, then thou mayst go in peace!&nbsp; And if thou art in
torment for a treasure, show me the spot, and I will take it
home, and then thou&rsquo;lt be at peace and grieve no
more.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>&ldquo;Then the goat jumped on the spot where the money
was hidden and sank as usual out of sight in fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the next day the young man went there and dug till
he discovered the gold, and the spirit of Marocchio was
relieved.&nbsp; But to this hour the goat is seen now and then
walking in his old haunt, where he sinks into the ground at the
same place.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The legend of a goat haunting a bridge is probably derived
from the custom of sacrificing an animal to new buildings or
erections.&nbsp; These were originally human sacrifices, for
which, in later times, the animals were substituted.&nbsp; Hence
the legends of the devil having been defrauded out of a promised
soul by driving a goat or cat over the bridge as a first
crosser.&nbsp; The spirits of the Ponte Vecchio and Ponte alla
Carraia clearly indicate this origin.</p>
<p>The next legend on this subject is that of the Ponte alle
Grazie, which was built by Capo, the fellow-pupil of Arnolfo,
under the direction of Rubaconte, who filled the office of
Podest&agrave; in 1235.&nbsp; Five hundred years are quite time
enough to attract traditions in a country where they spring up in
five; and when I inquired whether there was any special story
attached to the Ponte alle Grazie, I was soon supplied with the
following:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Le Ponte alle
Grazie</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When one passes under a bridge, or in halls of great
palaces, or the vault of a church, or among high rocks, if he
calls aloud, he will hear what is called the <i>echo</i> of his
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet it is really not his own voice which he hears, but
the mocking voices of spirits, the reason being that they are
confined to these places, and therefore we do not hear them in
the open air, where they are free.&nbsp; But we can hear them
clearly in great places enclosed, as, for instance, under vaults,
and far oftener in the country, because in limited spaces their
voices are confined and not lost.&nbsp; And these are the voices
of people who were merry and jovial while on earth, and who now
take delight <i>a rifare il verso</i>, to re-echo a strain.</p>
<p><!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>&ldquo;But under the Ponte alle Grazie we hear the cry
of the spirit of a girl.&nbsp; She was very beautiful, and had
grown up from infancy in constant companionship with a youth of
the neighbourhood, and so from liking as children they went on to
loving at a more advanced age, with greater fondness and with
deeper passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it went so far that at last the girl found herself
with child, and then she was in great trouble, not knowing how to
hide this from her parents.&nbsp; <i>Sta beccata da una
serpe</i>, as the proverb is; &lsquo;she had been stung by a
serpent,&rsquo; and now began to feel the poison.&nbsp; But the
youth was faithful and true, and promised to marry her as soon as
he could possibly arrange matters.&nbsp; So she was quieted for a
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she had a vilely false friend, and a most intimate
one, in a girl who, being a witch, or of that kind, hated her
bitterly at heart, albeit she knew well <i>portare bene la
maschera</i>, how to wear the mask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the poor girl told this false friend that she was
<i>enceinte</i>, and that her lover would marry her; and the dear
friend took her, as the saying is, a trip to Volterra, during
which a man was treated like a prince and robbed or murdered at
the end.&nbsp; For she insinuated that the marriage might fail,
and meantime she, the friend, would consult witches and
<i>fate</i>, who would get her out of her troubles and make all
right as sure as the Angelus.&nbsp; And the false friend went to
the witches, but she took them a lock of hair from the head of
the lover to conjure away his love and work harm.&nbsp; And
knowing what the bridal dress would be, she made herself one like
it in every detail.&nbsp; And she so directed that the bride on
the wedding morning shut herself up in a room and see no one till
she should be sent for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bride-to-be passed the morning in great anxiety,
and while waiting there received a large bouquet of
orange-flowers as a gift from her friend.&nbsp; And these she had
perfumed with a witch-powder.&nbsp; And the bride having inhaled
the scent, fell into a deep sleep, or rather trance, during which
she was delivered of a babe, and knew nothing of it.&nbsp; Now
the people in the house hearing the child cry, ran into the room,
and some one ran to the bridegroom, who was just going to be
married to the false friend, who had by aid of the witches put on
a face and a false seeming, the very counterpart of her he
loved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the unfortunate girl hearing that her betrothed
was <!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>being married, and maddened by shame and grief, rushed
in her bride&rsquo;s dress through the streets, and coming to the
Bridge delle Grazie, the river being high, threw herself into it
and was drowned; still holding the bouquet of orange-blossoms in
her hand, she was carried on the torrent into death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the young man, who had discovered the cheat, and
whose heart was broken, said, &lsquo;As we were one in life, so
we will be in death,&rsquo; and threw himself into the Arno from
the same place whence she had plunged, and like her was
drowned.&nbsp; And the echo from the bridge is the sound of their
voices, or of hers.&nbsp; Perhaps she answers to the girls and he
to the men; anyhow they are always there, like the hymns in a
church.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There is a special interest in the first two paragraphs of
this story, as indicating how a person who believes in spirits,
and is quite ignorant of natural philosophy, explains
phenomena.&nbsp; It is precisely in this manner that most early
science was confused with superstition; and there is more of it
still existing than even the learned are aware of.</p>
<p>I know not whether echoes are more remarkable in and about
Florence than elsewhere, but they are certainly specially noticed
in the local folk-lore, and there are among the witches
invocations to echoes, voices of the wind, and similar
sounds.&nbsp; One of the most remarkable echoes which I ever
heard is in the well of the Villa Guicciardini, now belonging to
Sir John Edgar.&nbsp; It is very accurate in repeating every
sound in a manner so suggestive of a mocking goblin, that one can
easily believe that a peasant would never doubt that it was
caused by another being.&nbsp; It renders laughter again with a
singularly strange and original effect.&nbsp; Even when standing
by or talking near this mystic fount, the echo from time to time
cast back scraps of phrases and murmurs, as if joining in the
conversation.&nbsp; It is worth observing (<i>vide</i> the story
of the Three Horns) that this villa once belonged to&mdash;and
is, as a matter of course, haunted by the ghost of&mdash;Messer
Guicciardini, the great writer, who <!-- page 81--><a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>was himself a
faithful echo of the history of his country, and of the wisdom of
the ancients.&nbsp; Thus into things do things repeat themselves,
and souls still live in what surrounded them.&nbsp; I have not
seen this mystic well noticed in any of the Florentine
guide-books of any kind, but its goblin is as well worthy an
interview as many better known characters.&nbsp; Yea, it may be
that he is the soul of Guicciardini himself, but when I was there
I forgot to ask him if it were so?</p>
<p>I can, however, inform the reader as to the incantation which
is needed to call to the spirit of the well to settle this
question.&nbsp; Take a copy of his &ldquo;Maxims&rdquo; and read
them through; then drink off one glass of wine to the health of
the author, and, bending over the well, distinctly
cry&mdash;&ldquo;Sei Messer Guicciardini, di
cosi?&rdquo;&mdash;strongly accentuating the last syllable.&nbsp;
And if the reply be in the affirmative, you may draw your own
conclusions.&nbsp; For those who are not Italianate, it will do
quite as well if they cry, &ldquo;Guicciardini?&nbsp; No or
yes?&rdquo;&nbsp; For even this echo is not equal to the Irish
one, which to &ldquo;<i>How do you do</i>?&rdquo; replied,
&ldquo;Pretty well, I thank you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a very good story of the Ponte alle Grazie, anciently
known as the Rubaconte, from the Podest&agrave; in whose year of
office it was built, told originally by Sachetti in his
<i>Novelle</i> and Manni, <i>Veglie Piacevoli</i>, who drew it
indeed from Venetian or Neapolitan-Oriental sources, and which is
best told by Leader Scott in &ldquo;The Echoes of Old
Florence.&rdquo;&nbsp; It still lives among the people, and is
briefly as follows, in another form:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">The Origin of
the Ponte alle Grazie</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was once in Florence a Podest&agrave; or chief
magistrate named Rubaconte, and he had been chosen in the year
1236, nor had he been long in office when a man called Bagnai,
because he kept a public bath, was brought before him on the
charge of murder.</p>
<p><!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>&ldquo;And Bagnai, telling his tale, said: &lsquo;This
is the very truth&mdash;<i>ne favola ne canzone di
tavola</i>&mdash;for I was crossing the river on the little
bridge with a hand-rail by the Palazzo Mozzi, when there came
riding over it a company of gentlemen.&nbsp; And it befell that I
was knocked over the bridge, and fell on a man below who was
washing his feet in the Arno, and lo! the man was killed by my
dropping on him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now to the Podest&agrave; this was neither eggs nor
milk, as the saying is, and he could at first no more conclude on
it than if one had asked him, &lsquo;<i>Chi nacque
prima&mdash;l&rsquo;uovo o la gallina</i>?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Which was born first&mdash;the hen or the
egg?&rsquo;&nbsp; For on one side the <i>bagnajolo</i> was
innocent, and on the other the dead man&rsquo;s relations cried
for vengeance.&nbsp; But after going from one side of his brain
to the other for five minutes, he saw &lsquo;from here to the
mountain,&rsquo; and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now I have listened to ye both, and this is a
case where one must&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Non giudicar per legge ni per
carte,<br />
Se non ascolti l&rsquo;un e l&rsquo;altra parte.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Judge not by law-books nor by chart,<br />
But look with care to either part.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And as it is said, &ldquo;Berta must drink from
her own bottle,&rdquo; so I decree that the <i>bagnaio</i> shall
go and wash his feet in the Arno, sitting in the same place, and
that he who is the first of his accusers shall fall from the
bridge on his neck, and so kill him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And truly this settled the question, and it was agreed
that the Podest&agrave; was <i>piu savio de gli
statuti</i>&mdash;wiser even than the law itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then Rubaconte did an even wiser thing, for he
determined to have a new bridge built in place of the old one,
and hence came the Ponte alle Grazie, &lsquo;of which he himself
laid the first foundation-stone, and carried the first basket of
mortar, with all due civic ceremony, in 1236.&rsquo; <a
name="citation82"></a><a href="#footnote82"
class="citation">[82]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;But as it is said, &lsquo;he who has drunk once will
drink again,&rsquo; it came to pass that Bagnai had to appear
once more as accused before the Podest&agrave;.&nbsp; One day he
met a man whose donkey had fallen and could not rise.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twas on the Ponte Vecchio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The owner seized the donkey by the head, Bagnai caught
him by the tail, and pulled so hard that the tail came off!</p>
<p><!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>&ldquo;Then the contadino or <i>asinaio</i> had Bagnai
brought before the Podest&agrave;, and claimed damages for his
injured animal.&nbsp; And Rubaconte decided that Bagnai should
keep the ass in his stable, and feed him well&mdash;until the
tail had grown again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As may be supposed, the <i>asinaio</i> preferred to
keep his ass himself, and go no farther in the case.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>This ancient tale recalls that of Zito, the German magician
conjuror, whose leg was pulled off.&nbsp; It is pretty evident
that the donkey&rsquo;s tail had been glued on for the
occasion.</p>
<p>I may here add something relative to the folk-lore of bridges,
which is not without interest.&nbsp; I once asked a witch in
Florence if such a being as a spirit of the water or one of
bridges and streams existed; and she replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is a spirit of the water as there is of
fire, and everything else.&nbsp; They are rarely seen, but you
can make them appear.&nbsp; <i>How</i>?&nbsp; Oh, easily enough,
but you must remember that they are capricious, and appear in
many delusive forms. <a name="citation83"></a><a
href="#footnote83" class="citation">[83]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is the way to see them.&nbsp; You must go at
twilight and look over a bridge, or it will do if it be in the
daytime in the woods at a smooth stream or a dark
pool&mdash;<i>che sia un poco oscuro</i>&mdash;and pronounce the
incantation, and throw a handful or a few drops of its water into
the water itself.&nbsp; And then you must look long and
patiently, always thinking of it for several days, when, <i>poco
&agrave; poco</i>, you will see dim shapes passing by in the
water, at first one or two, then more and more, and if you remain
quiet they will come in great numbers, and show you what you want
to know.&nbsp; But if you tell any one what you have seen, they
will never appear again, and it will be well for you should
nothing worse happen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a young man at Civitella in the Romagna
Toscana, and he was in great need of money.&nbsp; He had lost an
uncle who was believed to have left a treasure buried somewhere,
but no one knew where it was.&nbsp; Now this nephew was a
reserved, solitary youth, always by himself in lone places, <!--
page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>among ruins or in the woods&mdash;<i>un poco
streghon</i>&mdash;a bit of a wizard, and he learned this secret
of looking into streams or lakes, till at last, whenever he
pleased, he could see swarms of all kinds of figures sweeping
along in the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And one evening he thus saw, as in a glass, the form of
his uncle who had died, and in surprise he called out &lsquo;Zio
mio!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;My uncle!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then the uncle
stopped, and the youth said, &lsquo;Didst thou but know how I am
suffering from poverty!&rsquo;&nbsp; When he at once beheld in
the water his home and the wood near it, and a path, and the form
of his uncle passed along the path to a lonely place where there
was a great stone.&nbsp; Then the uncle pointed to the stone and
vanished.&nbsp; The next day the young man went there, and under
the stone he found a great bag of gold&mdash;and I hope that the
same may happen to all of us!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He who has sheep has wool in
store;<br />
He who has mills hath plenty of flour;<br />
He who hath land hath these at call;<br />
He who has money has got them all.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

85</span>THE BASHFUL LOVER<br />
<span class="smcap">a legend of the chiesa santa lucia in the via
de&rsquo; bardi</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;She never told her love&mdash;oh no!<br />
For she was mild and meek,<br />
And his for her he dared not show,<br />
Because he hadn&rsquo;t the cheek.<br />
&rsquo;Tis pity this should e&rsquo;er be past,<br />
For, to judge by what all men say,<br />
&rsquo;Twere best such difference should last<br />
Unto our dying day.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All who have visited Florence have noticed the Church of Santa
Lucia in the Via de&rsquo; Bardi, from the figure of the patron
with two angels over the door in Lucca della Robbia ware.&nbsp;
Of this place of worship there is in a jest-book a droll story,
which the reader may recall when he enters the building.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A young Florentine once fell desperately in
love with a beautiful lady of unsullied character and ready wit,
and so followed her about wherever she went; but he being sadly
lacking in wit and sense, at all four corners, never got the
nearer to her acquaintance, though he told all his friends how
irresistible he would be, and what a conquest he would make, if
he could only once get a chance to speak to her.&nbsp; Yet as
this lady prized ready wit and graceful address in a man above
all things, it will be seen that his chance was thin as a strip
of paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But one <i>festa</i> the lady went to the Church of
Santa Lucia in the Via dei Bardi, and one of the friends of the
slow-witted one said to him, &lsquo;Now is the lucky hour and
blooming chance for you.&nbsp; Go up and speak to her when she
approaches the font to take holy water.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>&ldquo;Now the lover had prepared a fine speech for the
lady, which he had indeed already rehearsed many times to his
friends with great applause; but when it came to utter it to the
lady a great and awful fear fell on him, the words
vanished&mdash;vanished from his memory, and he was dumb as a
dead ass.&nbsp; Then his friend poking him in the ribs, whispered
in his ear, &lsquo;But say <i>something</i>, man, no matter
what!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So with a gasp he brought out at last, &lsquo;Signora,
I would fain be your humble servant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To which the lady, smiling, replied, &lsquo;Well, I
have already in my house plenty of humble servants, and indeed
only too many to sweep the rooms and wash the dishes, and there
is really no place for another. . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the young man turned aside with sickness in his
heart.&nbsp; His wooing for that holiday was
o&rsquo;er.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This may be matched with the story of a bashful New England
lover of the olden time, for there are none such
now-a-days:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how I ever got courage
to do it; but one evening I went courting Miss Almira Chapin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when she came in, I sat for half-an-hour, and dared
not say a word.&nbsp; At last I made a desperate dash and got
out, &lsquo;Things are looking very green out of doors, Miss
Almira.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she answered, &lsquo;Seems to me they&rsquo;re
looking a great deal greener <i>in</i> doors this
evening.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That extinguished me, and I retreated.&nbsp; And when I
was outside I burst into tears.&rdquo;</p>

Ballads</i>,&rdquo; by <span class="smcap">C. G.

</blockquote>
<p>The manner in which many of the gods in exile still live in
Italy is very fully illustrated by the following story:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a hard thing sometimes now-a-days for a family to
pass for noble if they are poor, or only poor relations.&nbsp;
But it was easy in the old time, Signore Carlo, easy as drinking
good Chianti.&nbsp; A signore had only to put his shield with
something carved on it over his window, and he was all
right.&nbsp; He was noble <i>senza dubbio</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the nobles had their own noble stories as to what
these noble pictures in stone meant, but the ignoble people often
had another story just as good.&nbsp; Coarse woollen cloth wears
as well as silk.&nbsp; Now you may see on an old palazzo in the
Via de&rsquo; Cerchi, and indeed in several other places, a
shield with three rings.&nbsp; But people call them three
wheels.&nbsp; And this is the story about the three
wheels.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">La
Fortuna</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a man, <i>tanto buono</i>, as good as could
be, who lived in squalid misery.&nbsp; He had a wife and two
children, one blind and another <i>storpia</i> or crippled, and
so ugly, both&mdash;<i>non si dice</i>&mdash;beyond telling!</p>
<p>&ldquo;This poor man in despair often wept, and then he would
repeat:</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;The wheel of Fortune
turns, they say,<br />
But for me it turns the other way;<br />
I work with good-will, but do what I may,<br />
I have only bad luck from day to day.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, little to eat and less to wear, and two
poor girls, one blind and one lame.&nbsp; People say that Fortune
is blind herself, and cannot walk, but she does not bless those
who are like her, that is sure!&rsquo;&nbsp; And so he wailed and
wept, till it was time to go forth to seek work to gain their
daily bread.&nbsp; And a hard time he had of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now it happened that very late one night, or very early
one morning, as one may say, between dark and dawn, he went to
the forest to cut wood.&nbsp; When having called to Fortune as
was his wont&mdash;<i>Ai</i>! what was his surprise to
see&mdash;<i>tutta ad un tratto</i>&mdash;all at once, before his
eyes, a gleam of light, and raising his head, he beheld a lady of
enchanting beauty passing along rapidly, and yet not
walking&mdash;on a rolling ball&mdash;<i>e ciondolava le
gambe</i>&mdash;moving her limbs&mdash;I cannot say feet, for she
had none.&nbsp; In place of them were two wheels, and these
wheels, as they turned, threw off flowers from which there came
delicious perfume.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor man uttered a sigh of relief seeing this, and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Beautiful lady, believe me when I say that I
have invoked thee every day.&nbsp; Thou art the Lady of the
Wheels of Fortune, and had I known how beautiful thou art, I
would have worshipped thee for thy beauty alone.&nbsp; Even thy
very name is beautiful to utter, though I have never been able to
couple it with mine, for one may see that I am not one of the
fortunate.&nbsp; Yet, though thou art mine enemy, give me, I
pray, just a little of the luck which flies from thy wheel!</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yet do not believe, I pray, that I am envious of
those who are thy favourites, nor that because thou art my enemy
that I am thine, for if thou dost not deem that I am worthy,
assuredly I do not deserve thy grace, nor will I, like many, say
that Fortune is not beautiful, for having seen thee, I can now
praise thee more than ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I do not cast my favours always on those who
deserve them,&rsquo; replied Fortune, &lsquo;yet this time my
wheel shall assist thee.&nbsp; But tell me, thou man of honesty
and without envy, which wouldst thou prefer&mdash;to be fortunate
in all things thyself alone, or to give instead as much good luck
to <i>two</i> men as miserable as thou art?&nbsp; If thou wilt
gain the prize for <!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>thyself alone, turn and pluck one of
these flowers!&nbsp; If for others, then take two.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor man replied: &lsquo;It is far better, lady, to
raise two families to prosperity than one.&nbsp; As for me, I can
work, and I thank God and thee that I can do so much good to so
many, although I do not profit by it myself;&rsquo; and saying
this, he advanced and plucked two flowers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fortune smiled.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thou must have
heard,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;that where I spend, I am lavish
and extravagant, and assuredly thou knowest the saying that
&ldquo;Three is the lucky number,&rdquo; or nine.&nbsp; Now I
make it a rule that when I relieve families, I always do it by
threes&mdash;<i>la spando &agrave; tre famiglie</i>&mdash;so do
thou go and pluck a flower for thyself!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the poor man, hearing this, went to the wheels,
and let them turn till a very large fine flower came forth, and
seized it, whereat Fortune smiled, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I always favour the bold.&nbsp; Now go and sit
on yonder bench till some one comes.&rsquo;&nbsp; And saying
this, she vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There came two very poor woodcutters whom he knew
well.&nbsp; One had two sons, another a son and a daughter, and
one and all were as poor and miserable as could be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What has come over thee, that thou art looking
so handsome and young,&rsquo; said one amazed, as he came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what fine clothes!&rsquo; remarked the
second.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It shall be so anon for ye both,&rsquo; replied
the favourite of Fortune; &lsquo;only take these flowers and
guard them well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Si, Signore, they sat down on the bench three beggars,
and they rose three fine cavaliers, in velvet and satin, with
gold-mounted swords, and found their horses and attendants
waiting.&nbsp; And when they got home, they did not know their
wives or children, nor were they known unto them, and it was an
hour before all was got right.&nbsp; Then all went with them as
if it were oiled.&nbsp; The first man found a great treasure the
very first day in his cellar&mdash;in fine, they all grew rich,
and the three sons married the three girls, and they all put the
three wheels on their <i>scudi</i>.&nbsp; One of the wheels is
the ball on which Fortune rolled along, and the other two are her
feet; or else the three men each took a wheel to himself.&nbsp;
Anyhow, there they are, pick and choose, Signore&mdash;<i>chi ha
pi&uacute; cervello</i>, <i>l&rsquo;usi</i>!&mdash;let him who
has brains, brain!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, it is a saying that <i>ogni fior non fa
frutto</i>&mdash;every blossom doth not bear a fruit&mdash;but
the flowers of Fortune bear fruit enough to make up for the short
crop elsewhere.</p>
<p><!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>&ldquo;But there is some sense and use in such stories
as these, Signore, after all; for a poor devil who half
believes&mdash;and very often quite believes in them&mdash;gets a
great deal of hope and comfort out of them.&nbsp; They make him
trust that luck or fairies or something will give him a good turn
yet some day&mdash;<i>chi sa</i>?&mdash;and so he hopes, and
truly, as they say that no pretty girl is ever quite poor, so no
man who hopes is ever really broken&mdash;<i>grazie</i>,
<i>Signore</i>!&nbsp; I hope to tell you another story before
long.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There is something in the making Fortune with <i>two</i> heels
for feet which suggests a memory of skate-rollers.</p>
<p>I once published an article in the <i>Ethnologische
Monatsheft</i> of Budapest, which set forth more fully the idea
expressed in this tale, that the popular or fairy tale is a
source of comfort, or a Bible to the poor, for it always teaches
the frequently delusive, but always cheering lesson that
good-luck or fortune may turn up some day, even for the most
unfortunate.&nbsp; The Scripture promises happiness for the
poorest, or indeed specially for the poorest in the next life;
the fairy tale teaches that Cinderella, the despised, and the
youngest, humblest of the three, will win fortune while here on
earth.&nbsp; It inspires hope, which is a great secret of
happiness and success.</p>
<p>To which the learned Flaxius annotates:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hath escaped the author&mdash;as it hath indeed all
mankind&mdash;that as the first syllable of Fortuna is
<i>fort</i> (Latin <i>fortis</i>), so the true beginning of luck
is strength; and if we are to understand by <i>una</i>,
&lsquo;one&rsquo; or &lsquo;only,&rsquo; we may even believe that
the name means strength alone or vigorous will, in accordance
with which the ancients declared that &lsquo;Fortune favours the
bold,&rsquo; and also <i>Fortuna contentionis studiosa
est</i>&mdash;&lsquo;Fortune delights in strife.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Therefore she is ever fleeting in this world.&nbsp; <i>Fortuna
simul cum moribus immutatur</i>, as Boethius hath it.&rdquo;</p>

91</span>THE STORY OF THE UNFINISHED PALACE<br />
<span class="smcap">a legend of the via del
proconsolo</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, you have cheated me,&rsquo;
howled the devil to the architect.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I lay a curse
upon your work.&nbsp; It shall never be
finished.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Snow and Planche&rsquo;s</i>
&ldquo;<i>Legends of the Rhine</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All great and ancient buildings which were never finished have
a legend referring to their incompleteness.&nbsp; There was one
relative to the Cathedral of Cologne, which may be found in
Planche&rsquo;s &ldquo;Legends of the Rhine,&rdquo; and as there
is a <i>palazzo non finito</i> in Florence, I at once scented an
old story; nor was I disappointed, it being unearthed in due
time, and written out for me as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Il Palazzo non
Finito</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the corner of the Via del Proconsole and the Borgo
degli Albizzi there is an unfinished palace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great Signore Alessandro Strozzi had a friend who,
when dying, confided to him the care of his only son.&nbsp; And
it was a troublesome task, for the youth was of a strange
temper.&nbsp; And a vast property was left to the young man, his
father imploring him not to waste it, and to live in friendship
with his guardian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But his father had hardly closed his eyes in death
before this youth began to act wildly, and above all things to
gamble terribly.&nbsp; And as the saying is, <i>Il diavolo ha
parte in ogni giuoco</i>&mdash;&lsquo;The devil has a hand in
every game,&rsquo; so he soon brought himself into company with
the gamester.&nbsp; Now, as you have heard, &rsquo;tis <i>la
lingua o la bocca e quella che fa il giuoco</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Every game, as it is sung,<br />
Is won by mouth, or else by tongue.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;So this devil or imp by smooth talk succeeded in
deceiving <!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>the young heir, and leading him into
a compact by which he was to achieve for the Signore all the work
which might be required of him for a hundred years, no matter
what it was, and then the heir must forfeit his soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For some time the young man was satisfied with always
winning at gambling.&nbsp; Yes, he ruined scores, hundreds, and
piled up gold till he got sick of the sight of cards.&nbsp; You
know the saying, &lsquo;When the belly is full the eyes are
tired,&rsquo; and &lsquo;A crammed dove hates to fly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So for a while he kept the devil busy, bringing him a
girl here, and building him a tower there, sending him to India
for diamonds, or setting him at work to keep off storm and hail
from his vineyards, which the devil found hard work enough, I
promise you, Signore, for then he had to fight other devils and
witches.&nbsp; Then he put him at a harder job.&nbsp; There was a
ghost of a <i>stregone</i> or wizard who haunted his
<i>palazzo</i>.&nbsp; Now such ghosts are the hardest to lay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>E niente</i>, <i>Signore</i>,&rsquo; said the
devil.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>E vi passarebbe un carro di
fieno</i>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis nothing, my lord; one could drive a
cartload of hay through it.&rsquo; <a name="citation92"></a><a
href="#footnote92" class="citation">[92]</a>&nbsp; But the devil
had a devil of a time to lay <i>that</i> ghost!&nbsp; There was
clanking of chains and howling, and <i>il diavolo scatenato</i>
all night long ere it was done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>E finito</i>, <i>Signore</i>,&rsquo; said the
devil in the morning.&nbsp; But he looked so worn-out and tired,
that the young man began to <i>think</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he thought, &lsquo;This devil of mine is not quite
so clever as I supposed.&rsquo;&nbsp; And it is a fact that it
was only a <i>diavolino</i>&mdash;a small devil who had thought
the young man was a fool&mdash;in which he was mistaken.&nbsp; A
man may have <i>un ramo di pazzo come l&rsquo;olmo di
Fiesole</i>&mdash;&lsquo;be a bit of a fool,&rsquo; but &lsquo;a
fool and a sage together can beat a clever man,&rsquo; as the
saying is, and both were in this boy&rsquo;s brain, for he came
of wizard blood.&nbsp; So he reflected, &lsquo;Perhaps I can
cheat this devil after all.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he did it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moreover, this devil being foolish, had begun to be too
officious and consequential.&nbsp; He was continually annoying
the Signore by asking for more work, even when he did not want
it, as if to make a show of his immense ability and insatiable
activity.&nbsp; Finally, beginning to believe in his own power,
he <!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>began to appear far too frequently, uncalled, rising up
from behind chairs abruptly in his own diabolical form, in order
to inspire fear; but the young lad had not been born in Carnival
to be afraid of a mask, as the saying is, and all this only made
him resolve to send his attendant packing.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Chi ha pazienza, cugino,<br />
Ha i tordi grassi a un quattrino.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He who hath patience, mind me, cousin,<br />
May buy fat larks a farthing a dozen.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Now, amid all these dealings, the young signore had
contrived to fall in love with the daughter of his guardian,
Alessandro Strozzi, and also to win her affections; but he
observed one day when he went to see her, having the
<i>diavolino</i> invisible by his side, the attendant spirit
suddenly jibbed or balked, like a horse which stops before the
door, and refused to go farther.&nbsp; For there was a Madonna
painted on the outside, and the devil said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I see a virgin form divine,<br />
And virgins are not in my line;<br />
I&rsquo;m not especially devout:<br />
Go thou within&mdash;I&rsquo;ll wait without!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And the young man observing that his devil was
devilishly afraid of holy water, made a note of it for future
use.&nbsp; And having asked the Signore Alessandro Strozzi for
the hand of his daughter, the great lord consented, but made it a
condition that the youth should build for his bride a palace on
the corner of the Via del Proconsolo and the Borgo degli Albizzi,
and it must be ready within a year.&nbsp; This he said because in
his heart he did not like the match, yet for his daughter&rsquo;s
love he put this form upon it, and he hoped that ere the time
would be out something might happen to prevent the
marriage.&nbsp; <i>In fin che v&rsquo;&egrave; fiato
v&rsquo;&egrave; speranza</i>&mdash;while there is breath,
Signore, there is hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the young man having resolved to finish with his
devil for good and all, began to give him great hope in divers
ways.&nbsp; And one day he said to the imp:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Truly thou hast great power, but I have a mind
to make a great final game with thee.&nbsp; <i>Ogni bel giuoco
vuol durar poco</i>&mdash;no good game should last long, and let
us play this compact of ours out.&nbsp; If thou canst build for
me a palace at the corner of the Via del Proconsolo and the Borgo
degli Albizzi, and <!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>finish it in every detail exactly as
I shall order it, then will I be thine, and thou need&rsquo;st do
no more work for me.&nbsp; And if thou canst not complete it to
my taste, then our compact will be all smoke, and we two past
acquaintances.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now it is said that to cook an egg to a turn, make a
dog&rsquo;s bed to suit him exactly, or teach a Florentine a
trick, <i>sono tr&egrave; cose difficil&eacute;</i>&mdash;are
three very difficult things to do, and this contract for building
the palace on time with indefinite ornaments made the devil shake
in his shoes.&nbsp; However, he knew that &lsquo;Pippo found out
how to stand an egg on its end,&rsquo; <a
name="citation94"></a><a href="#footnote94"
class="citation">[94]</a> and where there&rsquo;s a will
there&rsquo;s a way, especially when you have &lsquo;all hell to
back you up&rsquo;&mdash;<i>tutto l&rsquo;inferno a
spalleggiarvi</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he built and built away, with one gang of devils
disguised as workmen by day, and another, invisible, by night,
and everybody was amazed to see how the palace rose like weeds
after a rain; for, as the saying is, <i>mala herba presto
cresce</i>&mdash;&lsquo;ill weeds grow apace,&rsquo; and this had
the devil to water it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Till at last one day, when the six months were nearly
up, the imp said to the master:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Ebbene</i>, Signore, it is getting to the
time for you to tell me how you would like to have the palace
decorated.&nbsp; Thus far everything has been done exactly as you
directed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah yes, I see&mdash;all done but the
finishing.&nbsp; Well, it may be a little hard, but I promise
you, on the word of a gentleman (<i>tra galant&rsquo; uomini una
parola e un instrumento</i>), that I will not ask you to do
anything which cannot be executed even by the artists of this
city.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the devil was delighted to hear this (for he was
afraid he might be called on to work miracles unheard of), and so
replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Top</i>! what man has done the devil can
do.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll risk the trick if you swear that men can
work it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I swear!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what is the finish?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, very easy.&nbsp; My wife who is to be is of
a very pious turn, and I want to please her.&nbsp; Firstly, all
the work must be equal in execution to the best by the greatest
masters&mdash;painting, sculpture, and gilding.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Agreed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Secondly, the subjects.&nbsp; Over the front
door&mdash;<i>bisogna mettermi Gesu Cristo onnipotente unitamente
a Maria e il suo divin figlio</i>, <i>Padre</i>, <i>Figlio e
Spirito Santo</i>&mdash;that is, the Holy Family and Trinity, the
Virgin and Child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wha&mdash;wha&mdash;what&rsquo;s that?&rsquo;
stammered the devil, aghast.&nbsp; &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t fair
play&mdash;not according to the game.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;On every door,&rsquo; continued the young man,
raising his voice, and looking severely at the devil, &lsquo;the
same subject is to be repeated on a thick gold ground, all the
ultramarine to be of the very best quality, washed in holy
water.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ugh! ugh! ugh!&rsquo; wailed the devil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The roof is to be covered with the images of
saints as pinnacles, and, by the way, wherever you have a blank
space, outside on the walls or inside, including
ceilings&mdash;just cover it with the same subjects&mdash;the
Temptation of Saint Antony or Saint&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, go to the devil with your saints and gold
grounds!&rsquo; roared the imp.&nbsp; &lsquo;Truly I have lost
this game; fishing with a golden hook is a fool&rsquo;s
business.&nbsp; There is the compact!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was night&mdash;deep, dark night&mdash;there came a
blinding flash of light&mdash;an awful crash of indescribable
unearthly sound, like a thunder-voice.&nbsp; The imp, taking the
form of a <i>civetta</i> or small owl, vanished through the
window in the storm-wind and rain, wailing, &lsquo;<i>Mai
finito</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it is said that to this day the small owl still
perches by night on the roof of the palace, wailing
wearily&mdash;&lsquo;Unfinished! unfinished!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In no country in the world has unscrupulous vigorous intellect
been so admired as in Italy, the land of the Borgias and
Machiavellis.&nbsp; In the rest of Europe man finds a master in
the devil; in Italy he aims at becoming the devil&rsquo;s
master.&nbsp; This is developed boldly in the legend of
&ldquo;Intialo,&rdquo; to which I have devoted another chapter,
and it appears as markedly in this.&nbsp; The idea of having an
attendant demon, whom the master, in the consciousness of
superior intellect, despises, knowing that he will crush him when
he will, is not to be found, I believe, in a single German,
French, or any other legend not Italian.</p>
<p><!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>If this be so, it is a conception well deserving study,
as illustrating the subtle and powerful Italian intellect as it
was first analysed by Macaulay, and is now popularly understood
by such writers as Scaife. <a name="citation96"></a><a
href="#footnote96" class="citation">[96]</a>&nbsp; It is indeed a
most unholy and unchristian conception, since it is quite at war
with the orthodox theology of the Church, as of Calvin and
Luther, which makes the devil the grand master of mankind, and
irresistible except where man is saved by a <i>special</i>
miracle or grace.</p>
<p>And it may also be noted from such traditions that folk-lore,
when it shall have risen to a sense of its true dignity and
power, will not limit itself to collecting variants of fairy
tales to prove the routes of races over the earth, but rise to
illustrating the characteristic, and even the &aelig;sthetic,
developments of different stocks.&nbsp; That we are now laying
the basis for this is evident.</p>
<p>Though the devil dared not depict lives and legends of the
saints upon the palace, he did not neglect to put his own ugly
likeness there, repeated above the four front windows in a
perfectly appalling Gothic style, which contrasts oddly with the
later and severe character of the stately building.&nbsp; These
faces are fiendish enough to have suggested the story.</p>
<p>It may here be mentioned that it was in the middle of the
Borgo degli Albizzi, near this palace, that that indefatigable
corpse-reviver and worker of miracles, San Zenobio, raised from
the dead the child of a noble and rich French lady.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then in that place there was put a pillar of white marble
in the middle of the street, as a token of a great
miracle.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>H&aelig;c fabula docet</i>&mdash;this
fable teaches,&rdquo; adds Flaxius the immortal, &ldquo;that
there was never yet anything left incomplete by neglect or
incapacity or poverty, be it in buildings or in that higher
structure, man himself, but what it was attributed <!-- page
97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>to
the devil.&nbsp; If it had not been for the devil, what fine
fellows, what charming creatures, we would all have been to be
sure!&nbsp; The devil alone inspires us to sin; <i>we</i> would
never have dreamed of it.&nbsp; Whence I conclude that the devil
is dearer to man, and a greater benefactor, than all the saints
and several deities thrown in, because he serves as a scudaway
scapegoat, and excellent excuse for the sins of all the orthodox
of all time.&nbsp; How horrible it would be were we all made unto
ourselves distinctly responsible for our sins&mdash;our
unfinished palaces, our good resolutions broken; and how very
pleasant it is that it is all the devil&rsquo;s fault, and not
our own!&nbsp; Oh my friends, did I believe as ye do&mdash;which
I don&rsquo;t&mdash;I would long ago have raised altars and
churches to the devil, wherein I would praise him daily as the
one who in spirit and in truth takes upon himself the sins of all
the world, bearing the burden of our iniquities.&nbsp; For saying
which thing, but in other words, the best Christian of his age,
Bishop Agobard, was hunted down well-nigh to death.&nbsp; Thus
endeth a great lesson!&rdquo;</p>

98</span>THE DEVIL OF THE MERCATO VECCHIO</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Have I not the magic wand, by means of
which, having first invoked the spirit Odeken, one can enter the
elfin castle?&nbsp; Is not this a fine trot on the devil&rsquo;s

Sabato of the Carnival that there entered four graceful youths of
noble air.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Arlecchino alle Nozze di Cana</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I very naturally made inquiry as to whether there was not a
legend of the celebrated bronze devil made by Giovanni di
Bologna, which remained until lately in the Mercato Vecchio, and
I obtained the following, which is, from intrinsic evidence,
extremely curious and ancient.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Il Diavolo alla
Cavolaia</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the corner of the Palace Cavolaia there were
anciently four devils of iron. <a name="citation98"></a><a
href="#footnote98" class="citation">[98]</a>&nbsp; These were
once four gentlemen who, being wonderfully intimate, had made a
strange compact, swearing fidelity and love among themselves to
death, agreeing also that if they married, their wives and
children and property should be all in common.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When such vows and oaths are uttered, the saints may
pass them by, but the devils hear them; they hear them in hell,
and they laugh and cry, &lsquo;These are men who will some day be
like us, and here for ever!&rsquo;&nbsp; Such sin as that is like
a root which, once planted, may be let alone&mdash;the longer it
is in the ground, the more it grows.&nbsp; <i>Terra non avvilisce
oro</i>&mdash;earth does not spoil gold, but even virtue, like
friendship, may grow into a great vice when it grows too
much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As it happened in this case.&nbsp; Well, the four
friends were invited to a great <i>festa</i> in that fatal palace
of the Cavolaia, and they all went.&nbsp; And they danced and
diverted themselves <!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>with great and beautiful ladies in
splendour and luxury.&nbsp; As the four were all singularly
handsome and greatly admired, the ladies came <i>con grandi
tueletti</i>&mdash;in their best array, <i>sfarzose per essere
corteggiate</i>&mdash;making themselves magnificent to be courted
by these gentlemen, and so they looked at one another with
jealous eyes, and indeed many a girl there would have gladly been
wife to them all, or wished that the four were one, while the
married dames wished that they could <i>fare i
sposamenti</i>&mdash;be loved by one or all.&nbsp; People were
wicked in those days!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what was their surprise&mdash;and a fearful
surprise it was&mdash;when, after all their gaiety, they heard at
three o&rsquo;clock in the morning the sound of a bell which they
had never heard before, and then divine music and singing, and
there entered a lady of such superhuman beauty as held them
enchanted and speechless.&nbsp; Now it was known that, by the
strict rules of that palace, the <i>festa</i> must soon close,
and there was only time for one more dance, and it was sworn
among these friends that every lady who danced with one of them,
must dance with all in succession.&nbsp; Truly they now repented
of their oath, for she was so beautiful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the lady advancing, pointed out one of the four,
and said, &lsquo;I will dance with him alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young signore would have refused, but he felt
himself obliged, despite himself, to obey her, and when they had
danced, she suddenly disappeared, leaving all amazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when they had recovered from the spell which had
been upon them, they said that as she had come in with the dawn
and vanished with the day, it must have been the Beautiful Alba,
the enchanting queen of the fairies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>festa</i> lasted for three days, and every night
at the same hour the beautiful Alba reappeared, enchanting all so
wonderfully, that even the ladies forgot their jealousy, and were
as much fascinated by her as were the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now of the four friends, three sternly reproached the
other for breaking his oath, they being themselves madly in love;
but he replied, and truly, that he had been compelled by some
power which he could not resist to obey her.&nbsp; But that, as a
man of honour, so far as he could, he would comply with the
common oath which bound them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they declared that he should ask her if she loved
him, and if she assented, that he should inform her of their
oath, and that she must share her love with all or
none&mdash;<i>altrimenti non avrebbe mai potuta sposarla</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>&ldquo;Which he did in good faith, and she answered,
&lsquo;Hadst thou loved me sincerely and fully, thou wouldst have
broken that vile oath; and yet it is creditable to thee that, as
a man of honour, thou wilt not break thy word.&nbsp; Therefore
thou shalt be mine, but not till after a long and bitter
punishment.&nbsp; Now I ask thy friends and thee, if to be mine
they are willing to take the form of demons and bear it openly
before all men.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when he proposed it to his friends, he found them
so madly in love with the lady that they, thinking she meant some
disguise, declared that to be hers they would willingly wear any
form, however terrible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the fair Alba, having heard them, said, &lsquo;Yes,
ye shall indeed be mine; more than that I do not promise.&nbsp;
Now meet me to-morrow at the Canto dei Diavoli&mdash;at the
Devil&rsquo;s Corner!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they gazed at her astonished, never having heard of
such a place.&nbsp; But she replied, &lsquo;Go into the street
and your feet shall guide you, and truly it will be a great
surprise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they laughed among themselves, saying, &lsquo;The
surprise will be that she will consent to become a wife to us
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when they came to the corner, in the night, what
was their amazement to see on it four figures of devils indeed,
and Alba, who said, &lsquo;Now ye are indeed mine, but as for my
being yours, that is another matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then touching each one, she also touched a devil, and
said, &lsquo;This is thy form; enter into it.&nbsp; Three of ye
shall ever remain as such.&nbsp; As for this fourth youth, he
shall be with ye for a year, and then, set free, shall live with
me in human form.&nbsp; And from midnight till three in the
morning ye also may be as ye were, and go to the Palazzo
Cavolaia, and dance and be merry with the rest, but through the
day become devils again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so it came to pass.&nbsp; After a year the image of
the chosen lover disappeared; and then one of the three was
stolen, and then another, till only one remained.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There is some confusion in the conclusion of this story, which
I have sought to correct.&nbsp; The exact words are, &ldquo;For
many years all four remained, till <i>one</i> was stolen away,
and that was the image of the young man who pleased the beautiful
Alba, who thus relieved him of the spell.&rdquo;&nbsp; But as
there has been always only one devil on <!-- page 101--><a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>the corner,
I cannot otherwise reconcile the story with the fact.</p>
<p>I have said that this tale is ancient from intrinsic
evidence.&nbsp; Such extravagant alliances of friendship as is
here described were actually common in the Middle Ages; they
existed in England even till the time of Queen Elizabeth.&nbsp;
In &ldquo;Shakespeare and his Friends,&rdquo; or in the
&ldquo;Youth of Shakespeare&rdquo;&mdash;I forget which&mdash;two
young men are represented as fighting a duel because each
declared that he loved the other most.&nbsp; There was no insane
folly of sentiment which was not developed in those days.&nbsp;
But this is so foreign to modern ideas, that I think it could
only have existed in tradition to these our times.</p>
<p>There were also during the Middle Ages strange heretical
sects, among whom such communism existed, like the polyandria of
the ancient Hindoos.&nbsp; There may be a trace of it in this
story.</p>
<p>Alba, Albina, or Bellaria, appear in several Tuscan
traditions.&nbsp; They are forms of the Etruscan Alpan, the fairy
of the Dawn, a sub-form of Venus, the spirit of Light and
Flowers, described in my work on &ldquo;Etruscan Roman
Traditions.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may be remarked as an ingenious touch
in the tale, that she always appears at the first dawn, or at
three o&rsquo;clock, and vanishes with broad day.&nbsp; This
distinguishes her from the witches and evil spirits, who always
come at midnight and vanish at three o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>The readiness with which the young men consented to assume the
forms of demons is easily explained.&nbsp; They understood that
it meant only a disguise, and it was very common in the Middle
Ages for lovers to wear something strange in honour of their
mistresses.&nbsp; The dress of a devil would only seem a joke to
the habitu&eacute;s of the Cavolaia.&nbsp; It may be also borne
in mind that in other tales of Florence it is distinctly stated
that spirits confined in statues, columns, <i>et cetera</i>, only
inhabit them &ldquo;as bees live in hives.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
appear to sleep in them by <!-- page 102--><a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>day, and
come out at night.&nbsp; So in India the saint or demon only
comes into the relic or image from time to time, or when
invoked.</p>
<p>After I had written the foregoing, I was so fortunate as to
receive from Maddalena yet another legend of the bronze imp of
Giovanni di Bologna, which tale she had unearthed in the purlieus
of the Mercato Vecchio.&nbsp; I have often met her when thus
employed, always in the old part of the town, amid towering old
buildings bearing shields of the Middle Ages, or in dusky
<i>vicoli</i> and <i>chiassi</i>, and when asked what she was
doing, &rsquo;twas ever the same reply, &ldquo;<i>Ma</i>,
<i>Signore Carlo</i>, there&rsquo;s an old woman&mdash;or
somebody&mdash;lives here who knows a story.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
then I knew that there was going to be a long colloquy in dialect
which would appal any one who only knew choice Italian, the end
of which would be the recovery, perhaps from half-a-dozen
<i>vecchie</i>, of a legend like the following, of which I would
premise that it was not translated by me, but by Miss Roma
Lister, who knew Maddalena, having taken lessons from her in the
sublime art of <i>battezare le carte</i>, or telling fortunes by
cards, and other branches of the black art.&nbsp; And having
received the manuscript, which was unusually illegible and
troublesome, I asked Miss Lister to kindly transcribe it, but
with great kindness she translated the whole, only begging me to
mention that it is given with the most scrupulous accuracy, word
for word, from the original, so far as the difference of language
permitted.</p>

<i>The Imp of the Devil&rsquo;s Corner and the Pious
Fairy</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was once a pious fairy who employed all her time
in going about the streets of Florence in the shape of a woman,
preaching moral sermons for the good of her hearers, and singing
so sweetly that all who heard her voice fell in love with
her.&nbsp; Even the women forgot to be jealous, so charming was
her <!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>voice, and dames and damsels
followed her about, trying to learn her manner of singing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the fairy had converted so many folk from their
evil ways, that a certain devil or imp&mdash;who also had much
business in Florence about that time&mdash;became jealous of the
intruder, and swore to avenge himself; but it appears that there
was as much love as hate in the fiend&rsquo;s mind, for the
fairy&rsquo;s beautiful voice had worked its charm even when the
hearer was a devil.&nbsp; Now, besides being an imp of superior
intelligence, he was also an accomplished ventriloquist (or one
who could imitate strange voices as if sounding afar or in any
place); so one day while the pious fairy in the form of a
beautiful maiden held forth to an admiring audience, two voices
were heard in the street, one here, another there, and the first
sang:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Senti o bella una parola,<br />
Te la dico a te sola,<br />
Qui nessun ci puo&rsquo;l sentire<br />
Una cosa ti vuo dire;<br />
Se la senti la stemperona,<br />
L&rsquo;a un voce da buffona<br />
Tiene in mano la corona. <a name="citation103"></a><a
href="#footnote103" class="citation">[103]</a><br />
Per fare credere a questo o quella,<br />
Che l&rsquo;e sempre una verginella.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hear, O lovely maid, a word,<br />
Only to thyself I&rsquo;d bear it,<br />
For it must not be o&rsquo;erheard,<br />
Least of all should the preacher hear it.<br />
&rsquo;Tis that, while seeming pious, she,<br />
Holding in hand a rosary,<br />
Her talk is all hypocrisy,<br />
To make believe to simple ears,<br />
That still the maiden wreath she wears.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Then another voice answered:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;La risposta ti vuo dare,<br />
Senza farti aspettare;<br />
Ora di un bell&rsquo; affare,<br />
Te la voglio raccontare,<br />
Quella donna che sta a cantare,<br />
E una Strega di queste contrade,<br />
Che va da questo e quello,<br />
A cantarle indovinello,<br />
A chi racconta: Voi siete<br />
Buona donna affezionata.<br />
Al vostro marito, ma non sapete,<br />
Cie&rsquo; di voi un &rsquo;altra appasionata.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Friends, you&rsquo;ll not have long to
wait<br />
For what I&rsquo;m going to relate;<br />
And it is a pretty story<br />
Which I am going to lay before ye.<br />
That dame who singing there you see<br />
Is a witch of this our Tuscany,<br />
Who up and down the city flies,<br />
Deceiving people with her lies,<br />
Saying to one: The truth to tell,<br />
I know you love your husband well;<br />
But you will find, on close inspection,<br />
Another has his fond affection.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In short, the imp, by changing his voice artfully, and
singing his ribald songs everywhere, managed in the end to
persuade people that the fairy was no better than she should be,
and a common mischief-maker and disturber of domestic
peace.&nbsp; So the husbands, becoming jealous, began to quarrel
with their wives, and then to swear at the witch who led them
astray or put false suspicion into their minds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it happened that the fairy was in high favour with
a great saint, and going to him, she told all her troubles and
the wicked things which were said of her, and besought him to
free her good name from the slanders which the imp of darkness
had spread abroad (<i>l&rsquo;aveva chalugnato</i>).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the saint, very angry, changed the devil into a
bronze figure (<i>mascherone</i>, an architectural ornament), but
first compelled him to go about to all who had been influenced by
his slanders, and undo the mischief which he had made, and
finally to make a full confession in public of everything,
including his designs on the beautiful fairy, and how he hoped by
compromising her to lead her to share his fate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly the imp cut but a sorry figure when compelled to
thus stand up in the Old Market place at the corner of the
Palazzo Cavolaia before a vast multitude and avow all his dirty
little tricks; but he contrived withal to so artfully represent
his passionate love for the fairy, and to turn all his sins to
that account, that many had compassion on him, so that indeed
among the people, in time, no one ever spoke ill of the <i>doppio
povero diavolo</i>, or doubly poor devil, for they said he was to
be pitied since he had no love on earth and was shut out of
heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor did he quite lose his power, for it was said that
after he had been confined in the bronze image, if any one spoke
ill of him or said, &lsquo;This is a devil, and as a devil he can
never enter Paradise,&rsquo; then the imp would persecute that
man with <!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>strange voices and sounds until such
time as the offender should betake himself to the Palazzo della
Cavolaia, and there, standing before the bronze image, should ask
his pardon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if it pleased the Diavolino, he forgave them, and
they had peace; but if it did not, they were pursued by the
double mocking voice which made dialogue or sang duets over all
their sins and follies and disgraces.&nbsp; And whether they
stayed at home or went abroad, the voices were ever about them,
crying aloud or tittering and whispering or hissing, so that they
had no rest by day or night; and this is what befell all who
spoke ill of the Diavolino del Canto dei Diavoli.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The saint mentioned in this story was certainly Pietro Martire
or Peter the Martyrer, better deserving the name of murderer,
who, preaching at the very corner where the bronze imp was
afterwards placed, declared that he beheld the devil, and
promptly exorcised him.&nbsp; There can be little doubt that the
image was placed there to commemorate this probably &ldquo;pious
fraud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is only since I wrote all this that I learned that there
were formerly <i>two</i> of these devils, one having been stolen
not many years ago.&nbsp; This verifies to some extent the
consistency of the author of the legend, &ldquo;The Devil of the
Mercato Vecchio,&rdquo; who says there were four.</p>
<p>There is a very amusing and curious trait of character
manifested in the conclusion of this story which might escape the
reader&rsquo;s attention were it not indicated.&nbsp; It is the
vindication of the &ldquo;puir deil,&rdquo; and the very evident
desire to prove that he was led astray by love, and that even the
higher spirit could not take away all his power.&nbsp; Here I
recognise beyond all question the witch, the fortune-teller and
sorceress, who prefers Cain to Abel, and sings invocations to the
former, and to Diana as the dark queen of the <i>Strege</i>, and
always takes sides with the heretic and sinner and magian and
goblin.&nbsp; It is the last working of the true spirit of
ancient heathenism, for the fortune-tellers, and especially those
of the mountains, all come of families who have been regarded as
enemies <!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>by the Church during all the Middle
Ages, and who are probably real and direct descendants of Canidia
and her contemporaries, for where this thing is in a family it
never dies out.&nbsp; I have a great many traditions in which the
hand of the heathen witch and the worship of &ldquo;him who has
been wronged&rdquo; and banished to darkness, is as evident as it
is here.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;Which indeed seems to show,&rdquo; comments the learned
Flaxius, &ldquo;that if the devil is never quite so black as he
is painted, yet, on the other hand, he is so far from being of a
pure white&mdash;as the jolly George Sand boys, such as Heine and
Co., thought&mdash;that it is hard to make him out of any lighter
hue than mud and verdigris mixed.&nbsp; <i>In medio tutissimus
ibis</i>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis also to be especially noted, that in
this legend&mdash;as in Shelley&rsquo;s poem&mdash;the Devil
appears as a meddling wretch who is interested in small things,
and above all, as given to gossip:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Devil sat down in London town<br />
Before earth&rsquo;s morning ray,<br />
With a favourite imp he began to chat,<br />
On religion, and scandal, and this and that,<br />
Until the dawn of day.&rdquo;</p>

class="pagenum">p. 107</span>SEEING THAT ALL WAS RIGHT<br />
<span class="smcap">a legend of the porta a san
nicol&ograve;</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;God keep us from the devil&rsquo;s
lackies,<br />
Who are the aggravating jackies,<br />
Who to the letter execute<br />
An order and exactly do&rsquo;t,<br />
Or else, with fancy free and bold,<br />
Do twice as much as they are told,<br />
And when reproved, cry bravely, &lsquo;Oh!<br />

From all such, wheresoe&rsquo;er they be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Libera nos</i>,
<i>Domine</i>!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Porta a San Nicol&ograve; in Florence is, among other
legends, associated with a jest played by the famous Barlacchia
on a friend, the story of which runs as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an old saying that <i>la porta di dietro &egrave;
quella che ruba la casa</i> (it is the back gate which robs a
house), and it was going back to the gate of San Nicol&ograve;
which robbed a man of all his patience.&nbsp; This man had gone
with Barlacchia the jester from Florence to Val d&rsquo;Arno, and
on returning they had stopped in the plain of Ripolo, where the
friend was obliged to delay for a time, while Barlacchia went
on.&nbsp; Now it was so late that although Barlacchia was certain
to reach the Porto a San Nicol&ograve; in time to enter, it was
doubtful whether the one who came later could do so unless a word
should be spoken in advance to the guard, who for friendship or a
fee would sit up and let the late-comer in.&nbsp; Therefore the
friend said to the jester, &lsquo;<i>Di gratia facesse sostenere
la porta</i>&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;See that the gate is all
right,&rsquo; or that all is right at the bridge&mdash;meaning,
of course, that he should make it right with the guardian to let
him in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when Barlacchia came to the gate, he indeed asked
the officer in charge <i>se questi si sostengo</i>&mdash;whether
it was all right, and if it stood firmly, and was in no danger of
falling, affirming that he was making special inquiry at request
of a <!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>friend who was commissioner of the
city gates and bridges, and obtained a paper certifying that the
gate was in excellent condition, after which he went home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trotting along on his mule came the friend, who,
believing that Barlacchia had made it all right with the guard,
had not hurried.&nbsp; But he found it was all wrong, and that
&lsquo;a great mistake had been made somewhere,&rsquo; as the eel
said when he was thrown into boiling hot oil instead of cold
water.&nbsp; For he found the gate locked and nobody to let him
in, so that in a great rage he was obliged to go back to an inn
which was distinguished for nothing but its badness, <i>dove
stette con gran disagio quella notte</i> (where he passed the
night in great discomfort).</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when morning came, he passed the gate, but stopped
and asked whether Barlacchia had been there the night
before.&nbsp; To which the guard answered, &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; and
that he had been very particular in his inquiries as to whether
the doors were firm on their hinges, and if the foundations were
secure; on hearing which, the man saw that he had been sold, <a
name="citation108"></a><a href="#footnote108"
class="citation">[108]</a> and going to the Piazza Signoria, and
meeting Barlacchia, <i>gli disse rilevata villania</i>, let him
have abuse in bold relief and large proportion, saying that it
was infamous to snipe his equal in all things and better in most,
in such a low-flung manner, unbecoming a half-grown
chimney-sweep, and that if he did not respect himself too much to
use improper or strong language, he would say that Barlacchia was
a dastardly blackguard and a son of a priest.&nbsp; To which
Barlacchia remonstrated that he had performed to perfection
exactly what he had promised to do, yea, <i>a punto</i>, to the
very letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now by this time half Florence had assembled, and being
delighted beyond all measure at this racy dispute, insisted on
forming a street-court and settling the question <i>alla
fresca</i>.&nbsp; And when the evidence was taken, and all the
facts, which long in darkness lay, were brought full clearly to
the light of day, there was such a roaring of laughter and
clapping of lands that you would have sworn the Guelfs and
Ghibellines had got at it again full swing.&nbsp; But the verdict
was that Barlacchia was acquitted without a stain on his
character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>H&aelig;c fabula docet</i>,&rdquo; comments Flaxius,
&ldquo;that there be others besides Tyll Eulenspiegel who make
mischief by fulfilling laws too literally.&nbsp; And there are no
people in this world who contrive to break the Spirit of
Christianity so much as those who follow it simply to the
Letter.&rdquo;</p>

VACCHERECCIA</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On Dunmore Heath I also slewe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A monstrous wild and cruell beaste<br />
Called the Dun Cow of Dunmore plaine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who many people had opprest.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&mdash;<i>Guy</i>, <i>Earl of
Warwick</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Via Vacchereccia is a very short street leading from the
Signoria to the Via Por San Maria.&nbsp; <i>Vaccherricia</i>,
also <i>Vacchereccia</i>, means a cow, and is also applied
scornfully to a bad woman.&nbsp; The following legend was given
to me as accounting for the name of the place.&nbsp; A well-known
Vienna beerhouse-restaurant, Gilli and Letta&rsquo;s, has
contributed much of late years to make this street known, and it
was on its site that, at some time in &ldquo;the fabled
past,&rdquo; the building stood in which dwelt the witch who
figures in the story.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">La Via
Vacchereccia</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There lived long ago in the Via Vacchereccia a poor
girl, who was, however, so beautiful and graceful, and sweet in
her manner, that it seemed to be a marvel that she belonged to
the people, and still more that she was the daughter of the woman
who was believed to be her mother, for the latter was as ugly as
she was wicked, brutal, and cruel before all the world, and a
witch in secret, a creature without heart or humanity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor was the beautiful Artemisia&mdash;such being the
name of the girl&mdash;in reality her daughter, for the old woman
had stolen her from her parents, who were noble and wealthy, when
she was a babe, and had brought her up, hoping that when grown
she could make money out of her in some evil way, and live <!--
page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>upon her.&nbsp; But, as sometimes happens, it seemed as
if some benevolent power watched over the poor child, for all the
evil words and worse example of the witch had no effect on her
whatever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now it happened that Artemisia in time attracted the
attention and love of a young gentleman, who, while of moderate
estate, was by no means rich; and he had learned to know her
through his mother, an admirable lady, who had often employed
Artemisia, and been impressed by her beauty and goodness.&nbsp;
So it happened that the mother favoured the son&rsquo;s suit, and
as Artemisia loved the young man, it seemed as if her sufferings
would soon be at an end, for be it observed that the witch
treated the maid at all times with extraordinary cruelty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it did not suit the views of the old woman at all
that the girl on whom she reckoned to bring in much money from
great protectors, and whom she was wont to call the cow from whom
she would yet draw support, should settle down into the wife of a
small noble of moderate means.&nbsp; So she not only scornfully
rejected the suit, but scolded and beat Artemisia with even
greater wickedness than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there are times when the gentlest natures
(especially when supported by good principles and truly good
blood) will not give way to any oppression, however cruel, and
Artemisia, feeling keenly that the marriage was most advantageous
for her, and a great honour, and that her whole heart had been
wisely given, for once turned on the old woman and defied her,
threatening to appeal to the law, and showing that she knew so
much that was wicked in her life that the witch became as much
frightened as she was enraged, well knowing that an investigation
by justice would bring her to the bonfire.&nbsp; So, inspired by
the devil, she turned the girl into a cow, and shut her up in a
stable in the courtyard of the house, where she went every day
two or three times to beat and torture her victim in the most
fiendish manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile the disappearance of Artemisia had excited
much talk and suspicion, as it followed immediately after the
refusal of the old woman to give her daughter to the young
gentleman.&nbsp; And he indeed was in sad case and great
suffering, but after a while, recovering himself, he began to
wonder whether the maid was not after all confined in the Via
Vacchereccia.&nbsp; And as love doubles all our senses and makes
the deaf hear, and, according to the proverb, &lsquo;he who finds
it in his heart <!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>will feel spurs in his
flanks,&rsquo; so this young man, hearing the old woman spoken of
as a witch, began to wonder whether she might not be one in
truth, and whether Artemisia might not have been <i>confinata</i>
or enchanted into some form of an animal, and so imprisoned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, full of this thought, he went by night to the
house, where there was an opening like a window or portal in the
courtyard, and began to sing:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Batte le dodici a una campana,<br />
Si sente appena dalla lontana.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Se almeno la voce potessi sentire,<br />
Della mia bella che tanto deve soffrire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Midnight is striking, I hear it afar,<br />
High in the heaven shines many a star.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And oh that the voice of the one I could
hear,<br />
Who suffers so sadly&mdash;the love I hold dear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh stars, if you&rsquo;re looking with pity on
me,<br />
I pray you the maid from affliction to free!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;As he sang this, he heard a cow lowing in the
courtyard, and as his mind was full of the idea of enchantment,
his attention was attracted to it.&nbsp; Then he sang:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If enchanted here you be,<br />
Low, but gently, <i>one</i>, <i>two</i>, <i>three</i>!<br />
Low in answer unto me,<br />
And a rescue soon you&rsquo;ll see.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Then the cow lowed three times, very softly, and the
young man, delighted, put to her other questions, and being very
shrewd, he so managed it as to extract with only yea and nay all
the story.&nbsp; Having learned all this, he reflected that to
beat a terrier &rsquo;tis well to take a bulldog, and after much
inquiry, he found that there dwelt in Arezzo a great sorcerer,
but a man of noble character, and was, moreover, astonished to
learn from his mother that this <i>gran mago</i> had been a
friend of his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And being well received by the wise man, and having
told his story, the sage replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Evil indeed is the woman of whom you
speak&mdash;a black witch of low degree, who has been allowed, as
all of her kind are, to complete her measure of sin, in order
that she may receive her full measure of punishment.&nbsp; For
all things may <!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>be forgiven, but not cruelty, and
she has lived on the sufferings of others.&nbsp; Yet her power is
of a petty kind, and such as any priest can crush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Go to the stable when she shall be absent, and I
will provide that she shall be away all to-morrow.&nbsp; Then
bind verbena on the cow&rsquo;s horns, and hang a crucifix over
the door, and sprinkle all the floor with holy water and incense,
and sing to the cow:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The witch is not thy mother in
truth,<br />
She stole thee in thy early youth,<br />
She has deserved thy bitterest hate,<br />
Then fear not to retaliate;<br />
And when she comes to thee again,<br />
Then rush at her with might and main;<br />
She has heaped on thee many a scorn,<br />
Repay it with thy pointed horn.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And note that there is a <i>halter</i> on the
cow&rsquo;s neck, and this is the charm which gives her the form
of a cow, but it cannot be removed except in a church by the
priest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to this he added other advice, which was duly
followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the next day the young man went to the stable, and
did all that the wise man had bid, and hiding near, awaited the
return of the witch.&nbsp; Nor had he indeed long to wait, for
the witch, who was evidently in a great rage at something, and
bore a cruel-looking stick with an iron goad on the end, rushed
to the courtyard and into the stable, but fell flat on the floor,
being overcome by the holy water.&nbsp; And the cow, whose halter
had been untied from the post, turned on her with fury, and
tossed and gored her, and trampled on her till she was senseless,
and then ran full speed, guided by the young man, to the
Baptistery, into which she entered, and where there was a priest
awaiting her.&nbsp; And the priest sprinkled her with holy water,
and took the halter from her neck, and she was disenchanted, and
became once more the beautiful Artemisia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this done, the young man took the halter, and
hurrying back to the stable, put it about the neck of the witch,
who at once became a cow without horns, or such as are called
&lsquo;the devil&rsquo;s own.&rsquo;&nbsp; And as she, maddened
with rage, rushed forth, attacking everybody, all the town was
soon after her with staves, pikes, and all their dogs, and so
they hunted her down through the Uffizzi and along Lung&rsquo;
Arno, all roaring and screaming and barking, out into the
country, for she gave them a long run and a good chase, till they
came to a gate of a <!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span><i>podere</i>, over which was a
Saint Antony, who, indignant that she dared pass under him,
descended from his niche, and gave her a tremendous blow with his
staff between the horns, or where they would have been if she had
possessed them.&nbsp; Whereupon the earth opened and swallowed
her up, amid a fearful flashing of fire, and a smell which was
even worse than that of the streets of Siena in
summer-time&mdash;which is often so fearful that the poorer
natives commonly carry fennel (as people do perfumed vinaigrettes
in other places) to sniff at, as a relief from the horrible
odour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when all this was done, the <i>mago</i> revealed to
the maiden that her parents, who were still living, were very
great and wealthy people, so that there was soon a grand reunion,
a general recognition, and a happy marriage.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Maidens, beware lest witches catch
you;<br />
Think of the Via Vacchereccia;<br />
And tourists dining in the same,<br />
Note how the street once got its name.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: right">&mdash;<i>Sage Stuffing for Young

</blockquote>
<p>There are in Italy, as elsewhere, families to whom a fatality
or tradition is attached.&nbsp; The following is a curious legend
of the kind:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">La Fattuchiera
della Porta alla Croce</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a very old Florentine family which lived in a
castle in the country.&nbsp; The elder or head of this family had
always one room in which no one was ever allowed to enter.&nbsp;
There he passed hours alone every day, and woe to any one who
dared disturb him while there.&nbsp; And this had been the case
for generations, and no one had ever found out what the secret
was.&nbsp; This was, of course, a great vexation to the ladies of
the family&mdash;<i>perche la donna e sempre
churiosa</i>&mdash;women being always inquisitive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And most inquisitive of all was a niece of the old man,
who had got it into her head that the secret was simply a great
treasure which she might obtain.&nbsp; Therefore she resolved to
consult with a certain witch, who would tell her what it was, and
how she could enter the mysterious room.&nbsp; This sorceress
lived hard by the Porta alla Croce, for there are always many
witches in that quarter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The witch, who was a very large tall woman, made the
niece go with her to an isolated small house, and thence along a
path, the lady in advance.&nbsp; While so doing, the latter
turned her head to look behind her, and at that instant heard the
cry of a <i>civetta</i> or small owl.&nbsp; The witch exclaimed,
&lsquo;My dear <!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>lady, what you wish for will hardly
be granted; I fear there is a great disaster awaiting
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they went into a field, and the fortune-teller
produced a goblet of coloured glass, and called to the swallow,
which is a bird of good omen, and to the small owl, which
forebodes evil, and said, &lsquo;Whichever shall alight first on
the edge of this cup will be a sign to you of success or
failure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the first which came and sat upon the cup was the
owl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the witch said, &lsquo;What there is in that room
I cannot reveal, for it disturbs my soul far too much.&nbsp; But
I know that the number of that room is thirteen, and you can
infer for yourself what that portends; and more I cannot tell
you, save that you should be extremely careful and keep a
cheerful heart&mdash;otherwise there is great trouble awaiting
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the lady returned home in a great rage at her
disappointment, and all the more resolved to enter the
room.&nbsp; Then all the family finding this out, reproached her,
and urged her not to be so distracted; and she, being obstinate,
only became the more determined; for she was furious that she
could not force an old man to reveal a secret which had been
handed down for many generations, and which could only be
confided to one, or to the eldest, when the old man should
die.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And at last her evil will or mania attained such
command over her, that she resolved to kill all the family one by
one, till the succession of the secret should come to her.&nbsp;
And so, after boiling deadly herbs with care, she made a strong
subtle poison.&nbsp; And by this means she put to death her
parents, brothers and sisters, aunts and all the family, without
remorse, so resolved was she to master the secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last to perish was her grandfather, and calling her
to his bedside he said, &lsquo;We have all died by thy hand; we
who never did thee any harm; and thou hast felt no remorse.&nbsp;
This thou didst to gain a treasure, and bitterly wilt thou be
disappointed.&nbsp; Thy punishment will begin when thou shalt
learn what the thing was so long hidden: truly there was sorrow
enough therein, without the misery which thou hast added to
it.&nbsp; That which thou wilt find in the chamber is a
skull&mdash;the skull of our earliest ancestor, which must always
be given to the care of the eldest descendant, and I now give it
to thee.&nbsp; And this thou must do.&nbsp; Go every morning at
seven o clock into the room and close the windows.&nbsp; Then
light <!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>four candles before the skull.&nbsp;
In front of it there lies a great book in which is written the
history of all our family, my life and thine; and see that thou
do this with care, or woe be unto thee!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therewith the old man died, and scarcely had he
departed ere she called an old woman who was allied and devoted
to the family, and in a rage told her all the secret.&nbsp; The
old woman reproved her, saying that she would bring punishment on
herself.&nbsp; But, without heeding this, the lady ran to the
chamber, entered, and seeing the skull, gave it a kick and hurled
it from the window, far below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But a minute after she heard a rattling sound, and
looking at the window, there the skull was grinning at her.&nbsp;
Again she threw it down, and again it returned, and was with her
wherever she went; day after day, waking or sleeping, the skull
was always before her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last fear came over her, and then horror, and she
said to the old woman, &lsquo;Let us go to some place far, far
away, and bury the skull.&nbsp; Perhaps it will rest in its
grave.&rsquo;&nbsp; The old woman tried to dissuade her, and they
went to a lonely spot at a great distance, and there they dug
long and deep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dug till a great hole was made, and the lady standing
on the edge dropped the skull into it.&nbsp; Then the hole spread
into a great pit, flame rose from it&mdash;the edge crumbled
away&mdash;the guilty woman fell into the fire, and the earth
closed over it all, and there was no trace left of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The skull returned to the castle and to its room;
people say it is there to this day.&nbsp; The old woman returned
too, and being the last remote relation, entered into possession
of the property.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There is perhaps not one well-educated person in society in
England who has not had the opportunity to remark how very much
any old family can succeed in being notorious if it can only once
make it known that it has an hereditary <i>secret</i>.&nbsp;
Novels will be written on it, every member of it will be pointed
out everywhere, and people who do not know the name of a
sovereign in Europe can tell you all about it and them.&nbsp; And
the number is not small of those who consider themselves
immensely greater because they have in some way mastered
something which <!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>they are expected to keep
concealed.&nbsp; I could almost believe that this
&ldquo;&rsquo;orrible tale&rdquo; was composed as a satire on
family secrets.&nbsp; But I believe that she who told it firmly
believed it.&nbsp; <i>Credo quia absurdum</i> would not be well
understood among humble folk in Italy.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;To this I may add,&rdquo; writes Flaxius, &ldquo;that
there is an English legend of a certain skull which always
returned to a certain window in a tower.&nbsp; <i>Apropos</i> of
which there is a poem called <i>The Student and the Head</i> in
&lsquo;Hans Breitmann in Germany&rsquo; (London: T. Fisher Unwin,
1895), prefaced by a remark to the effect that the subject is so
extensive as to deserve a book&mdash;instancing the head of the
physician Douban in the &lsquo;Arabian Nights,&rsquo; with that
of Orpheus, which spoke to Cyrus, and that of the priest of
Jupiter, and another described by Trallianus, and the
marvellously preserved head of a saint in Olaf Tryggvason&rsquo;s
Saga, and the Witch&rsquo;s Head of Rider Haggard, with many
more, not to speak of the talking Teraphim heads, and Friar
Bacon&rsquo;s bust.&nbsp; With which a thoroughly exhaustive list
should include the <i>caput mortuum</i> of the alchemists</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And the dead-heads of the
Press.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

TRINITA</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Columna Florentina</i>.&mdash;Prope
Sanct&aelig; Trinitatis &aelig;dem ingens et sublimis columna
erecta, cujus in fastigio extat justitia.&nbsp; Eam erexit Cosmus
Magnus Dux, cui per urbem deambulanti, illic de victoria
renunciatum fuit quam Malignani Marchio in Senarum finibus anno
1555 contra Petrum Strozium obtinuit.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Templum
Natur&aelig; Historicum</i>, Darmstadt, 1611.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vesti una Colonna,<br />
Le par una donna.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Italian Proverb</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The central spot of Florence is the grand column of granite
which stands in the middle of the Piazza di Santa Trinit&agrave;,
in the Via Tornabuoni, opposite the Palazzo Feroni.&nbsp; It was
brought from the Baths of Caracalla in Rome, and erected in 1564
by Cosimo I., &ldquo;in commemoration of the surrender of Siena
in 1554, and of the destruction of the last liberties of Florence
by the victory at Monte Murlo, 1537, over those whom his tyranny
had driven into exile, headed by Filippo and Piero Strozzi.&nbsp;
It is surmounted by a statue of &lsquo;Justice&rsquo; in
porphyry, by <i>Ferruci</i>,&rdquo; says Murray&rsquo;s
Guide-Book&mdash;the Italian declares it to be by <i>Taddi</i>,
adding that the column was from the Baths of Antoninus, and was a
gift to Cosimo I. from Pius IV.</p>
<p>There is a popular legend that once on a time a poor girl was
arrested in Florence for having stolen a chain, a bracelet, or
some such article of jewellery of immense value.&nbsp; She was
thrown into prison, but though there was collateral or indirect
evidence to prove her guilt, the stolen article could not be
found.&nbsp; Gossip and rumour constituted ample grounds for
indictment and trial, and torture did the rest in the pious times
when it was generally taught and believed that Providence would
always rescue the innocent, and that everybody who came to grief
on the gallows had deserved it for something or other at some
time, and that it was all right.</p>
<p>So the girl was executed, and almost forgotten.&nbsp; When a
long time after, some workman or other was sent up to the <!--
page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>top of the column of the Piazza Trinit&agrave;, and
there found that a jackdaw or magpie had built a nest in the
balance or scales held by Justice, and in it was the missing
jewel.</p>
<p>This is an Italian form of &ldquo;The Maid and the
Magpie,&rdquo; known the world over from ancient times.&nbsp; The
scales suggest a droll German story.&nbsp; There was in front of
a certain palace or town-hall, where all criminals were tried, a
statue of Justice holding a pair of scales, and these were not
cast solid, but were a <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> pair of
balances.&nbsp; And certain low thieves having been arrested with
booty&mdash;whatever it was&mdash;it was discovered that they had
divided it among themselves very accurately, even to the
ounce.&nbsp; At which the magistrate greatly marvelling, asked
them how they could have done it so well, since it had appeared
that they had not been in any house between the period of the
theft and their arrest.&nbsp; Whereupon one replied: &ldquo;Very
easily, your Honour, for, to be honourable, honest, and just as
possible, we weighed the goods in the scales of Justice itself,
here on the front of the <i>Rath-haus</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is for every reason more probable that the bird which stole
the jewel of the column was a jackdaw than a magpie, and it is
certainly fitter that it should have been thus in Florence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is well known,&rdquo; says Oken in his &ldquo;Natural
History&rdquo; (7 B. Part I. 347), &ldquo;that the jackdaw steals
glittering objects, and carries them to its nest.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Hence the ancient legend of Arne, who so greatly loved gold, that
she sold her native isle Siphnos to Minos, and was for that
turned by the gods into a daw (Ovid&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Metamorphoses,&rdquo; vii. 466).&nbsp; As a
mischief-making, thieving, and chattering bird of black colour,
the jackdaw was naturally considered evil, and witches, or their
imps, often assumed its form.&nbsp; In fact, the only really good
or pious bird of the kind on record known to me, is the jackdaw
of Rheims sung by Ingoldsby Barham.</p>
<p>According to Kornmannus, the column was placed where it now
stands, because Cosimo was in the Piazza Trinit&agrave; when he
heard the news of the surrender of Siena.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>After I had written the foregoing legend, I found the
following:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">La Colonna di
Santa Trinit&agrave;</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pillar di Santa Trinit&agrave; was in times a
meeting-place for fairies (<i>Fate</i>), whither they went afoot
or in their <!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>carriages.&nbsp; At the base of the
column there was a great stone, and there they exchanged
greetings or consulted about their affairs.&nbsp; They were all
great ladies, of kindly disposition.&nbsp; And when it came that
any one was cast into the city prison, they inquired into the
affair, and then a <i>fate</i> would go as a magistrate in
disguise and question the accused.&nbsp; Now they always knew
whether any one spoke the truth, and if the prisoner did so, and
was deserving mercy, they delivered him; but if he lied, they
left him to be hanged, with a <i>buon pro vi
faccia</i>!&mdash;Much good may it do you!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of evenings they assembled round the rock at the foot
of the column in a great company, and had great merriment and
love-making.&nbsp; Then in the crowd a couple would descend, or
one after another into their vaults below, and then come again,
often taking with them mortals who were their friends or
favourites.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their chief was a matron who always held a pair of
scales.&nbsp; Now when they were to judge the fate of any one,
they took with great care the earth from one of his footprints,
and weighed it most scrupulously, for thereby they could tell
whether in his life he had done more good or evil, and it was
thus that they settled the fate of all the accused in the
prisons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it often came to pass that when prisoners were
young and handsome, these <i>fate</i> or fairy-witches took them
from their cells in the prison through subterranean ways to their
vaults under the Trinit&agrave;, and passed the time merrily
enough, for all was magnificent there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But woe unto those, no matter how handsome they might
be, who betrayed the secrets and the love of the
<i>fate</i>.&nbsp; Verily they had their reward, and a fine long
repentance with it, for they were all turned into cats or mice,
and condemned to live in the cellars and subterranean passages of
the old Ghetto, which is now destroyed&mdash;and a nasty place it
was.&nbsp; In its time people often wondered that there were so
many cats there, but the truth is that they were all people who
had been enchanted by those who were called in olden time <i>le
Gran Dame di Firenze</i>&mdash;the Great Ladies of Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the image holding the scales is called <i>la
Giustizia</i>, but it really represents the Matrona, or Queen of
the Fate, who of old exercised such strict justice with her
scales in Florence.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>This is, I am confident, a tradition of great antiquity, for
all its elements are of a very ancient or singularly <!-- page
121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>witch-like nature.&nbsp; In it the <i>fate</i> are
found in their most natural form, as <i>fates</i>, weighing
justice and dealing out rewards and punishments.&nbsp; Justice
herself appears na&iuml;vely and amusingly to the witches as
Queen of the <i>Fate</i>, who are indeed all spirits who have
been good witches in a previous life.</p>
<p>What is most mystical and peculiarly classic Italian is the
belief that the earth on which a human being has trod can be used
wherewith to conjure him.&nbsp; This subject is treated elsewhere
in my &ldquo;Etruscan Roman Traditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great stone at the base of the column was a kind of
palladium of the city of Florence.&nbsp; There are brief notices
of it in many works.&nbsp; It would be curious if it still exists
somewhere and can be identified.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A great palladium, whose virtues lie<br />
In undefined remote antiquity;<br />
A god unformed, who sleeps within a stone,<br />
Which sculptor&rsquo;s hand as yet has never known;<br />
Brought in past ages from some unknown shore;<br />
Our fathers worshipped it&mdash;we know no more.&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Or&rsquo; San Michele is a very beautiful church in the
Italian Gothic style in the Via Calzaioli.&nbsp; It was
originally a market or stable below and a barn or granary above,
whence some derive its name from <i>Horreum Sancti Michaelis</i>,
and others from the Italian <i>Orto</i>, a garden, a term also
applied to a church-congregation.&nbsp; &ldquo;The statues and
decorations on the exterior are among the best productions of the
Florentine school of sculpture.&rdquo;&nbsp; As that of Saint
Eloy or San Eligio, the blacksmith, with great pincers at an
anvil, in a sculpture representing a horse being shod, is the
most conspicuous on the fa&ccedil;ade, the people have naturally
concluded that the church was originally a stable or
smithy.&nbsp; The legend of the place is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">La Chiesa
Or&rsquo; San Michele</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was originally a stable and coach-house
(<i>rimessa</i>), and there was a hayloft above.&nbsp; Every
night the horses were heard to neigh, and in the morning they
were found all curried and well managed, and no one knew who did
it; but none of the grooms ever shed any tears over it that ever
I heard of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, the master of the place had a son, a priest named
Michele, who was so holy that he worked many miracles, so that
all began to call him a saint.&nbsp; And after he died he
appeared to his parents in a dream, and told them that the stable
and barn should be transformed into a church, and that he would
read mass therein thrice a day.</p>
<p><!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>&ldquo;But his parents wished to have him buried under
the altar of a church which was on their estate in the country,
but the saint did not wish to be buried there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day one of the grooms of the stable found that a
horse could not move a foot, so he ran to call the
<i>manescalco</i>, or blacksmith, who led the horse to his
forge.&nbsp; And when he took the hoof to examine it, lo! it came
off at the joint and remained in his hand.&nbsp; Then the smith
said that the horse should be killed, because he was now
worthless.&nbsp; But the horse struck his stump on the hoof, and
the latter joined itself to his leg as firmly as ever it had
been.&nbsp; But in doing this the old shoe fell off, whence it
comes to this day that whoever finds an old horse-shoe gets luck
with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the smith had shod the horse anew, he tried to
lead it back into the stable, but it refused to enter.&nbsp; Then
it was plain that this was a miracle worked by San Michele.&nbsp;
So they removed all the horses and hay from the building, and
made of it the fine church which is now called <i>La Chiesa di
Or&rsquo; San Michele</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There is a vast mass of tradition extant relative to the
Horse, enough to make a large volume, and in it there is a great
deal which is so nearly allied to this story as to establish its
antiquity.&nbsp; Karl Blind has found an old Norse spell, in
which, by the aid of Balder and Odin, the lameness of a
horse&rsquo;s ankle or pastern joint can be cured.&nbsp; There is
another version of this story, which runs as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">The Smith and
Saint Peter</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a good thing in this world to be bold and have a
good opinion of one&rsquo;s self; yes, and to hold your head
high&mdash;but not so high as to bend over backwards&mdash;else
that may happen to you which befell the celebrated cock of
Aspromonte.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what happened to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only this, Signore&mdash;he was so cocky, and bent his
head so far backwards, that his spurs ran into his eyes and
blinded him.&nbsp; Now, the cock reminds me of Saint Peter, and
too much cheek of the <i>ferrajo spacciato</i>, or the saucy
smith, who wanted to equal him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happened once that the Lord and Saint Peter came to
<!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>a forge, and the smith was about to lead a horse from
the stable to the anvil to shoe him.&nbsp; Saint Peter said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thou hast boasted that thou art the best smith
in the world, and canst work such wonders in shoeing as man never
beheld.&nbsp; Canst thou not shoe this horse without taking him
to the forge?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Neither thou, nor I, nor any man can do
it,&rsquo; replied the smith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saint Peter took the hoof in his left hand, gave it a
rap with the side of his right across the joint, and the hoof
fell off.&nbsp; Then Saint Peter carried it to the anvil,
fastened a new shoe on it, returned and put it on the horse
again, who stamped with it as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the smith, like all boasters, was a great fool, and
he only thought that this was something which he had not learned
before, and so cried boldly, &lsquo;Oh, that is only the
Bolognese manner of taking hoofs off and putting them on&mdash;we
do it much better here in Florence!&rsquo;&nbsp; So he seized the
horse&rsquo;s hoof, and with one blow of a hatchet cut it
off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And now put it on again,&rsquo; said Saint
Peter.&nbsp; The smith tried, but it would not stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The horse is bleeding to death rapidly,&rsquo;
remarked the Saint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I believe,&rsquo; said the smith ruefully,
&lsquo;that I am a fool in folio.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Pi&ugrave; matto che un granchio</i>&mdash;as
crazy as a crawfish,&rsquo; solemnly added one of his
assistants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Pazzo a bandiera</i>&mdash;as wild and
witless as a flapping flag,&rsquo; quoth another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Matto di sette cotte</i>&mdash;an idiot seven
times baked,&rsquo; chimed in Saint Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A <i>campanile</i>&mdash;a church bell-tower of
a fool,&rsquo; contributed his wife, who had just come in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor horse continued to bleed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You are like the mouse,&rsquo; added a
neighbour, &lsquo;who thought because he had dipped the end of
his tail in the meal, that he owned and could run the
mill.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Florentine method of shoeing horses,&rsquo;
remarked Saint Peter gravely, &lsquo;does not appear to be
invariably successful.&nbsp; I think that we had better recur to
mine.&rsquo;&nbsp; And with this he put the hoof to the ankle,
and <i>presto</i>! the miracle was wrought again.&nbsp; That is
the story.&nbsp; In most cases, Signore, <i>un pazzo gitta una
pietra nel pozzo</i>&mdash;a fool rolls a rock into a well which
it requires a hundred wise men to get out again.&nbsp; This time
a single sage <!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>sufficed.&nbsp; But for that you
must have the Lord at your back, as Saint Peter had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do they say, as foolish as a crawfish or
lobster?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, Signore, the <i>granchio</i>, be he lobster or
crawfish, carries his head in the <i>scarsella</i>, which is a
hole in his belly.&nbsp; Men who have their brains in their
bellies&mdash;or gluttons&mdash;are generally foolish.&nbsp; But
what is the use of boasting of our wisdom?&nbsp; He who has
neither poor men nor fools among his relations was born of the
lightning or of thunder.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There is another story current among the people, though it is
in print, but as it is a merry one, belonging truly enough to the
folk-lore of Florence, I give it as it runs:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have heard of Piovano Arlotto, who made this our
town so lively long ago.&nbsp; It was rich then, indeed.&nbsp;
There are more flowers than florins in Florence now: <i>ogni fior
non fa frutto</i>&mdash;all flowers do not bear fruit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it happened one day that Piovano, having heard a
good story from Piero di Cosimo de&rsquo; Medicis, answered with
another.&nbsp; Now the tale which Messer Piero di Cosimo told was
this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once there lived in Florence a poor shoemaker, who went
every morning to the Church of San Michele Berteldi&mdash;some
say it was at San Bartolommeo, and maybe at both, for a good
story or a big lie is at home anywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he used to pray before a John the Baptist in
wood, or it may have been cast in plaster, or moulded in wax,
which was on the altar.&nbsp; One morning he prayed scalding hot,
and the <i>chierico</i>&mdash;a boy who waits on the priest, who
was a young rascal, like all of his kind&mdash;overheard him say:
&lsquo;Oh, Saint John, I pray thee make known to me two
things.&nbsp; One is whether my wife is good and true to me, and
the other what will become of my only son.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the mass-boy, who had hidden himself behind the
altar, replied in a soft, slow, strange voice: &lsquo;Know, my
son, that because thou hast long been so devout to me, thou shalt
be listened unto.&nbsp; Return hither to-morrow, and thou wilt be
answered; and now go in peace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the shoemaker, having heard this, verily believed
that Saint John had spoken to him, and went his way with great
<!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>rejoicing.&nbsp; So, bright and early the next morning,
he was in the church, and said: &lsquo;Saint John, I await thy
reply.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the mass-boy, who was hidden as before, replied:
&lsquo;Oh, my son, I am sorry to say that thy wife is no better
than she should be&mdash;<i>ha fatto fallo con pi&ugrave;
d&rsquo;uno</i>&mdash;and everybody in Florence except thee knows
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And my son?&rsquo; gasped the shoemaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>He will be hung</i>,&rsquo; replied the
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The shoemaker rose and departed abruptly.&nbsp; In the
middle of the church he paused, and, without a sign of the cross,
and putting on his cap, he cried: &lsquo;What sort of a Saint
John are you, anyhow?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Saint John the Baptist,&rsquo; replied the
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Sia col malanno e con la mala Pasque che
Iddio ti dia</i>!&mdash;Then may the Lord give you a bad year and
a miserable Easter-tide!&nbsp; You never utter aught save evil,
and it was for thy evil tongue that Herod cut thy head
off&mdash;and served thee right!&nbsp; I do not believe a word of
all which thou hast told me.&nbsp; I have been coming here every
day for twenty-five years, and never asked thee for anything
before; but I will make one more vow to thee, and that
is&mdash;never to see thy face again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when Messer Cosimo had ended, Piovano Arlotto
replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;One good turn deserves another.&nbsp; It is not
many years ago since a poor <i>farsettajo</i>, or doublet-maker,
lived in Florence, his shop being close to the Oratorio di Orto
San Michele, <a name="citation126"></a><a href="#footnote126"
class="citation">[126]</a> and every morning he went to worship
in the church, and lit a candle before a picture representing
Christ as a child disputing with the Doctors, while his mother
enters seeking him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And after he had done this daily for more than
twenty-five years, it happened that his little son, while looking
on at a game of ball, had a tile fall on his head, which wounded
him terribly.&nbsp; The doctors being called in, despaired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The next morning the poor tailor went to his
devotions in Or&rsquo; San Michele, bearing this time, instead of
a farthing taper, a great wax-candle; and kneeling, he spoke
thus: &ldquo;<i>Dolce Signor mio Ges&ugrave; Cristo</i>, I beg
thee to restore my son to health.&nbsp; Thou knowest that I have
worshipped thee here for twenty-five years, and never asked for
anything before, and thou thyself can best bear witness to
it.&nbsp; This my son is all my happiness on earth, and he was
also most devoted to thee.&nbsp; <!-- page 127--><a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>Should he
be taken away, I would die in despair, and so I commend myself to
three!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then he departed, and coming home, learned that
his son had died.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The next morning, in grief and anger, he entered
Orto San Michele, and, without any candle, he went directly to
the picture, and, without kneeling, broke forth in these words:
&ldquo;<i>Io ti disgrazio</i>&mdash;I dislike, disown, and
despise thee, and will return here no more.&nbsp; Five-and-twenty
years have I worshipped thee and never asked for anything before,
and now thou dost refuse me my request.&nbsp; If I had only gone
to the great crucifix there, I daresay I should have got all I
wanted; but this is what comes of trusting to a mere child, for,
as the proverb says, <i>Chi s&rsquo;impaccia con fanciulli</i>,
<i>con fanciulli si ritrova</i>&mdash;he who troubles himself
with children will himself be treated as a
child.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It is worth remarking, as regards the tone and character of
this tale, that such freedom was commonest when people were most
devout.&nbsp; The most sceptical critics generally agree that
these stories of Piovano Arlotto are authentic, having been
dictated by him, and that he had a very exceptional character in
his age for morality, honesty, and truth.&nbsp; He himself
declared, without being contradicted, that he was the only priest
of whom he knew who did not keep a mistress; and yet this story
is simply an average specimen of the two hundred connected with
his name, and that they in turn are identical in character with
all the popular wit and humour of the time.</p>
<p>Regarding the image of the Holy Blacksmith, Saint Eligius or
Eloi, the authors of &ldquo;Walks in Florence&rdquo; say that it
is attributed to Nanni di Banco, and is meagre and stiff, but has
dignity, which accords admirably with the character of most
saints, or their ideals.&nbsp; It is evident that the <i>bon
roi</i> Dagobert was considered as the type of all that was free
and easy&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Le bon roi Dagobert<br />
Mettait son culotte a l&rsquo;envers.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>Therefore he is contrasted with the very dignified
Saint Eloy, who was (like the breeches) quite the reverse,
declining to lend the monarch two sous, which Dagobert had
ascertained were in the holy man&rsquo;s possession.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The bas-relief below,&rdquo; continue the critics cited,
&ldquo;is more certainly by the hand of Nanni.&nbsp; It records a
miracle of Saint Eloy, who one day, when shoeing a restive horse
which was possessed by a demon, and was kicking and plunging, cut
off the animal&rsquo;s leg to fasten the shoe, and having
completed his task, made the sign of the cross and restored the
severed limb.&rdquo;&nbsp; I regret to say that this was written
without careful reference to the original.&nbsp; It was not the
<i>leg</i> of the horse which was severed, nor a limb, but only
the hoof at the pastern joint.</p>
<p>There is yet another explanation of this bas-relief, which I
have somewhere read, but cannot now recall&mdash;more&rsquo;s the
pity, because it is the true one, as I remember, and one
accounting for the presence of the female saint who is standing
by, evidently invisibly.&nbsp; Perhaps some reader who knows
Number Four will send it to me for a next edition.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that there is in Innsbruck, on the left
bank of the Inn, a blacksmith&rsquo;s shop, on the front of which
is a very interesting bas-relief of the fourteenth or fifteenth
century, representing Saint Peter or Eligius with the horse in a
smithy.</p>
<p>There is another statue on the exterior of this church, that
of Saint Philip, by the sculptor Nanni de Banco, concerning which
and whom I find an anecdote in the <i>Facetie Diverse</i>, <span
class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1636:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Now, it befell in adorning the church of
Or&rsquo; San Michele in Florence, that <i>I Consoli
d&rsquo;Arte</i> (Art Directors of Florence) wanting a certain
statue, wished to have it executed by Donatello, a most excellent
sculptor; but as he asked fifty <i>scudi</i>, which was indeed a
very moderate price for such statues as he made, they, thinking
it too dear, refused him, and gave it <!-- page 129--><a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>to a
sculptor <i>mediocre e mulo</i>&mdash;indifferent and
mongrel&mdash;who had been a pupil of Donatello; nor did they ask
him the price, supposing it would be, of course, less.&nbsp; Who,
having done his best, asked for the work eighty scudi.&nbsp; Then
the Directors in anger explained to him that Donatello, a
first-class sculptor, had only asked fifty; but as he refused to
abate a single <i>quattrino</i>, saying that he would rather keep
the statue, the question was referred to Donatello himself, who
at once said they should pay the man <i>seventy</i> scudi.&nbsp;
But when they reminded him that he himself had only asked fifty,
he very courteously replied, &lsquo;Certainly, and being a master
of the art, I should have executed it in less than a month, but
that poor fellow, who was hardly fit to be my pupil, has been
more than half a year making it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By which shrewd argument he not only reproached them
for their meanness and his rival for incapacity, but also
vindicated himself as an artist.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the story as popularly known.&nbsp; In it Nanni is
called Giovanni, and it is not true that he was an unworthy,
inferior sculptor, for he was truly great.&nbsp; There is another
legend of Or&rsquo; San Michele, which is thus given by Pascarel,
who, however, like most writers on Florence, is so extravagantly
splendid or &ldquo;gushing&rdquo; in his description of
everything, that untravelled readers who peruse his pages in good
faith must needs believe that in every church and palazzo there
is a degree of picturesque magnificence, compared to which the
Pandemonium of Milton, or even the Celestial City itself as seen
by Saint John, is a mere cheap Dissenting chapel.&nbsp; According
to him, Or&rsquo; San Michele is by right &ldquo;a world&rsquo;s
wonder, and a gift so perfect to the whole world, that, passing
it, one should need say (or be <i>compelled</i> to pronounce) a
prayer for Taddeo&rsquo;s soul.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which is like the
dentist in Paris, who proclaimed in 1847 that it was&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Presque
une crime<br />
De ne pas crier, &lsquo;<i>Vive</i> Fattet!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The legend, as told by this writer, and cited by Hare, is as
follows:</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>&ldquo;Surely nowhere in the world
is the rugged, changeless, mountain force of hewn stone piled
against the sky, and the luxuriant, dream-like poetic delicacy of
stone carven and shaped into leafage and loveliness, more
perfectly blended and made one than where San Michele rises out
of the dim, many-coloured, twisting streets, in its mass of ebon
darkness and of silvery light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other day, under the walls of it, I stood and
looked at its Saint George, where he leans upon his shield, so
calm, so young, with his bared head and his quiet eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That is our Donatello&rsquo;s,&rsquo; said a
Florentine beside me&mdash;a man of the people, who drove a horse
for hire in the public ways, and who paused, cracking his whip,
to tell this tale to me.&nbsp; &lsquo;Donatello did that, and it
killed him.&nbsp; Do you not know?&nbsp; When he had done that
Saint George he showed it to his master.&nbsp; And the master
said, &ldquo;It wants one thing only.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now this
saying our Donatello took gravely to heart, chiefly because his
master would never explain where the fault lay; and so much did
it hurt him, that he fell ill of it, and came nigh to
death.&nbsp; Then he called his master to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear
and great one, do tell me before I die,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;what is the one thing my statue lacks?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
master smiled and said: &ldquo;Only speech.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then I die happy,&rdquo; said our Donatello.&nbsp; And
he&mdash;died&mdash;indeed, that hour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I cannot say that the pretty story is true&mdash;it
is not in the least true; Donatello died when he was
eighty-three, in the Street of the Melon, and it was he himself
who cried, &lsquo;Speak then&mdash;speak!&rsquo; to his statue,
as it was carried through the city.&nbsp; But whether true or
false, this fact is surely true, that it is well&mdash;nobly and
purely well&mdash;with a people when the men amongst it who ply
for hire on its public ways think caressingly of a sculptor dead
five hundred years ago, and tell such a tale, standing idly in
the noonday sun, feeling the beauty and the pathos of it
all.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Truly, in a town half of whose income is derived from
art-hunting tourists, and where every vagabond offers himself, in
consequence, as a cicerone, it is no sign that &ldquo;all is
well&mdash;nobly and purely well&mdash;with a people,&rdquo;
because a coachman who had been asked which was Donatello&rsquo;s
Saint George by about five hundred English &ldquo;fares,&rdquo;
and nearly as many American young ladies&mdash;of <!-- page
131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>whom many of the latter told him all they knew about
it&mdash;should have picked up such a tale.&nbsp; In fact, while
I have been amazed at the <i>incredible</i> amount of legend,
superstitious traditions, and incantations existing among the
people, I have been struck by their great ignorance of art, and
all pertaining to it; of which, were it worth while, I could cite
convincing and amusing instances.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But as regards a vast proportion of the
&lsquo;sweet and light&rsquo; writing on the Renaissance and on
Italy which is at present fashionable,&rdquo; writes Flaxius,
&ldquo;I am reminded of the &lsquo;esthetic axe&rsquo;ems&rsquo;
of an American writer, the first of which were:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Art is a big thing.&nbsp; Always bust into teers
wen you see a pictur.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bildins and churches arn&rsquo;t of no account
unless they drive you clean out of your census.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Il spirito usci dal fiume a un tratto,<br

E venne come Dio l&rsquo;aveva fatto,<br />
E presentando come un cortegiano<br />
Alla donna gentil la destra mano,<br />
&lsquo;Scusate,&rsquo; disse si io vengo avanti<br />
E se vi do la mano sensa guanti.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Paranti</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following, as a French book of fables says, is &ldquo;a
poem, or rather prose rhymed:&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Two pretty maids one morning sat by the
rushing stream.&nbsp; It murmured glittering in the sun; it
seemed to sing as on it run, enchanting while a wantoning, as in
a merry dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Said one unto the other: &lsquo;I wish, and all in
truth, that the glorious dancing river were as fine and brave a
youth.&nbsp; Its voice is like an angel&rsquo;s, its drops of
light like eyes so bright are beautiful I wis.&nbsp; Oh,
ne&rsquo;er before, on sea or shore, did I love aught like
this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A voice came from the river: &lsquo;For a love thou
hast chosen me; henceforward, sweet, for ever thine own love I
will be.&nbsp; Wherever there is water, of Florence the fairest
daughter, by night or day or far away, thou&rsquo;lt find me
close by thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She saw bright eyes a shining in dewdrops on her
path&mdash;she returned unto the palace, she entered in a
bath.&nbsp; &lsquo;How the water doth caress me; &rsquo;tis
embracing me, I vow!&nbsp; <i>M&rsquo;abbracia</i>, <i>mi
baccia</i>&mdash;my lover has me now.&nbsp; Since fate has really
willed it, then to my fate I bow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven years have come and vanished, seven years of
perfect bliss.&nbsp; Whenever she washed in water, she felt her
lover&rsquo;s kiss.&nbsp; She washed full oft, I ween;
&rsquo;twas plain to be seen there was no maid in Florence who
kept herself so clean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little by little, as summer makes frogs croak in a
ditch, there spread about a rumour that the damsel was a
witch.&nbsp; They showed her scanty mercies; with cruelty
extreme, with blows and bitter curses, they cast her in the
stream.&nbsp; &lsquo;If she <!-- page 133--><a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>be
innocent, she&rsquo;ll sink, so hurl her from the Arno&rsquo;s
brink; if guilty, she will swim!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up rose from the sparkling river a youth who was fair
to see.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have loved thee, and for ever thine own
I&rsquo;ll truly be.&rsquo;&nbsp; He took her in his arms; she
felt no more alarms.&nbsp; &lsquo;Farewell to you all!&rsquo;
sang she; &lsquo;a fish cannot drown in the water; now I am a
fish, you know&mdash;the Arno&rsquo;s loving daughter.&nbsp;
<i>Per sempre addio</i>!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The foregoing is not literal, nor do I know that it is
strictly &ldquo;traditional;&rdquo; it is a mere short tale or
anecdote which I met with, and put into irregular metre to suit
the sound of a rushing stream.&nbsp; I take the liberty of adding
to it another water-poem of my own, which has become, if not
&ldquo;popular,&rdquo; at least a halfpenny broadside sold at
divers street-stands by old women, the history whereof is as
follows:&mdash;I had written several ballads in Italian in
imitation of the simplest old-fashioned lyrics, and was anxious
to know if I had really succeeded in coming down to the level of
the people, for this is a very difficult thing to do in any
language.&nbsp; When I showed them to Marietta Pery, she
expressed it as her candid opinion that they were really very
nice indeed, and that I ought for once in my life to come before
the public as a poet.&nbsp; And as I, fired by literary ambition,
at last consented to appear in this <i>r&ocirc;le</i>, Marietta
took a ballad, and going to E. Ducci, 32 Via Pilastri, who is the
Catnach of Florence (I advise collectors of the really curious to
buy his <i>soldo</i> publications), made an arrangement whereby
my song should appear as a broadside, the lady strictly
conditioning that from among his blocks Signore Ducci should find
a ship and a flying bird to grace the head and the end of the
lyric.&nbsp; But as he had no bird, she took great credit to
herself that for five francs she not only got a hundred copies,
but also had specially engraved for the work and inserted an
object which appears as flying to the right hand of the
ship.&nbsp; The song was as follows:</p>

In the sea one summer day;<br />
There came a ship with pirates,<br />
Who carried her away.</p>
<p>The ship due course was keeping<br />
On the waves as they rose and broke;<br />
The lovely lady, weeping,<br />
Thus to the captain spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Signor Capitano!<br />
O captain of the sea!<br />
I&rsquo;ll give you a hundred ducats<br />
If you will set me free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not take a hundred,<br />
You&rsquo;re worth much more, you know;<br />
I will sell you to the Sultan<br />

<p>Upon the windlass sitting,<br />
The lady began to sing:<br />
&ldquo;Oh, come to me, my lover!&rdquo;<br />
From afar a breeze just rising<br />
In the rigging began to ring.</p>
<p>Louder and ever louder<br />
The wind began to blow:<br />
Said the captain, &ldquo;I think your lover<br />
Is the squall which is coming over,<br />
Or the devil who has us in tow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stronger and ever stronger<br />
The tempest roared and rang,<br />
&ldquo;There are rocks ahead and the wind dead aft,<br />

Oh captain, for ever adieu!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I must in honesty admit that this my <i>d&eacute;but</i> as an
Italian poet was not noticed in any of the reviews&mdash;possibly
because I did not send it to them&mdash;and there were no
indications that anybody considered that a new Dante had arisen
in the land.&nbsp; It is true, as Marietta told me with much
delight, that the printer, or his foreman, had declared it was a
very good song indeed; but then he was an interested party.&nbsp;
And Marietta also kindly praised it to the skies (after she had
corrected it); but then Marietta was herself a far better poet
than I can ever hope to be, and could afford to be generous.</p>
<p>The reader will pardon me if I avail myself of the opportunity
to give another Italian ballad which I wrote on a theme which I
also picked up in Florence.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The picturesque height of San Miniato, now
the great cemetery of the city which dominates the Arno from the
south, has an especial religious and saintly interest.&nbsp; The
grand Basilica, with its glittering ancient mosaic, shines amid
the cypresses against the sky, and whether it gleams in the
sunlight against the blue, or is cut in black on the primrose sky
of twilight, it is equally
imposing.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Echoes of Old
Florence</i>,&rdquo; <i>by</i> <span class="smcap">Leader
Scott</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the old people of Florence, who still see visions and dream
dreams, and behold the wind and the stars at noonday (which
latter thing I have myself beheld), the very ancient convent of
San Miniato, &ldquo;the only one in Tuscany which has preserved
the ancient form of the Roman basilica,&rdquo; and the
neighbourhood, are still a kind of Sleepy Hollow, where witches
fly of nights more than elsewhere, where ghosts or
<i>folletti</i> are most commonly seen, and where the <i>orco</i>
and the nightmare and her whole ninefold disturb slumbers <i>a
bel agio</i> at their easiest ease, as appears by the following
narrative:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">San Miniato fra
le Torre</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a place which not long ago was surrounded by
towers, which were inhabited by many witches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those who lived in the place often noticed by night in
those towers, serpents, cats, small owls, and similar creatures,
and they were alarmed by frequently seeing their infants die like
candles blown out&mdash;<i>struggere i bambini come candele</i>;
nor could they understand it; but those who believed in
witchcraft, seeking in the children&rsquo;s beds, often found
threads woven together in forms like animals or garlands, and
when mothers had left their children alone with the doors open,
found their infants, on returning, in the fireplace under the
ashes.&nbsp; And <!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>at such times there was always found
a strange cat in the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And believing the cat to be a witch, they took it, and
first tying the two hind-paws, cut off the fore-claws
(<i>zampe</i>, claws or paws), and said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Fammi guarire<br />
La mia creatura;<br />
Altrimenti per te saranno<br />
Pene e guai!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cure my child,<br />
Or there shall be;<br />
Trouble and sorrow<br />
Enough for thee!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This happened once, and the next day the mother was
sitting out of doors with her child, when she saw a woman who was
her intimate friend at her window, and asked her if she would not
wash for her her child&rsquo;s clothes, since she herself was
ill.&nbsp; But the other replied: &lsquo;I cannot, for I have my
hands badly cut.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the mother in a rage told this to other women
whose children had been bewitched or died.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then all together seized the witch, and by beating her,
aided with knives crossed, and whatever injuries they could think
of, subdued her and drenched her under a tower with holy
water.&nbsp; And the witch began to howl, not being able to
endure this, and least of all the holy water!</p>
<p>&ldquo;When all at once there came a mighty wind, which blew
down the witch-tower, and carried away the witch, and killed all
the uncanny animals which dwelt in the ruins.&nbsp; And
unbelievers say that this was done by an earthquake; but this is
not true, for the witches were really the cause (<i>chagione</i>)
of its overthrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And though many old things are destroyed and rebuilt,
there are many cats still there which are assuredly witches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in the houses thereabout people often perceive and
see spirits, and if any one will go at night in the Piazza San
Miniato fra le Torri, especially where those old things (<i>chose
vecche</i>) were cleared away, he will see sparks of fire
(<i>faville di fuocho</i>) break out, and then flames; and this
signifies that some diabolical creature or animal is still
confined there which needs relief (<i>che a bisogna di bene</i>),
or that in that spot lies a treasure which requires to be
discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>I consider this as very interesting, because I most
truthfully guarantee that this specimen of witch-lore was written
in good faith and firm belief, and is not at all, like most of
the tales gleaned or gathered now-a-days, taken from people who
got them from others who perhaps only half believed in
them.&nbsp; She who wrote it has no more doubt that witch-cats
prowl, and that wild-fire hisses forth from evil spirits in
durance pent &rsquo;neath the soil of San Miniato, than that the
spirit of the Arno appears as &ldquo;a small white hand pointing
tremulously upwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is given in the <i>Faceti&aelig;</i> of Piovano Arlotto,
which is considered a truthful record of the adventures of its
subject, a tale relative to San Miniato which cannot here be
deemed out of place.&nbsp; It is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">La Testa di San
Miniato</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was in Florence a poor and learned
gentleman&mdash;<i>savio e da bene</i>, who was a good friend of
Piovano Arlotto, who was also good to him, since he had often
aided the former with money, meal, and many other things, and
indeed without such help he could hardly have fed his family; for
he had fourteen sons and daughters, and though the proverb says
<i>Figliuoli</i>, <i>mioli</i>, <i>&rsquo;lenzuoli non sono mai
troppi in una casa</i>&mdash;there are never too many children,
glasses, or linen sheets in a house, this good man found indeed
that he had too many of the former.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now to help dire need, this gentleman tried to buy on
credit two bales of cloth, one wherewith to clothe his family,
and the other to sell in order to make some money.&nbsp; To do
this, he needed some one to be his security, and he had recourse
to Piovano Arlotto, who willingly agreed to pay the manufacturer
in case the friend who gave his note could not meet it.&nbsp; Now
he found that the manufacturer had sadly cheated the purchaser in
the measure or quantity, fully one-half, as was also evident to
many others; however, as matters stood, he was obliged to let it
pass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As things were thus, the poor gentleman died and passed
<!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>away from this <i>misera vita</i> or sad life, and
Piovano was in deep grief for his loss, and as much for the poor
orphans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the note fell due, the manufacturer went to
Piovano Arlotto and asked for his money, saying that he only
demanded what was justly due to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after a few days&rsquo; delay, he paid the man
two-thirds of the sum, and ten florins for the time and trouble,
and said he would not give a farthing more.&nbsp; Then the dealer
begun to dun him, but he evaded every demand.&nbsp; Then the
merchant employed a young man, eighteen years of age, who had not
his equal in Florence to collect debts.&nbsp; And this youth set
to work in earnest to get from the priest the sum of about
twenty-eight gold florins, still due from the account.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a few days he had attacked Piovano a hundred times
with the utmost impudence, in the market, in the public squares,
on the streets at home, and in the church, without regard to
persons present, at all times, and in every aggravating way,
until the priest conceived a mortal hatred of the dun, and turned
over in his head many ways to get rid of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last he went one day to the Abbot of San Miniato or
Monte, and said to him: &lsquo;<i>Padre reverendo</i>, I seek
your paternal kindness to relieve a very distressing case in
which I am concerned.&nbsp; I have a nephew who is possessed by
the devil, one into whom an evil spirit has entered, and who has
a monomania that I owe him money, and is always crying to me
everywhere, &lsquo;When are you going to pay me?&nbsp; I want
twenty-eight florins.&rsquo;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a great pity, for
he is a fine young man, and something really ought to be done to
cure him.&nbsp; Now I know that the holy relic which you possess,
the worthy head of the glorious and gracious San Miniato, has
such a virtue, that, if it be once placed on the head of this
poor youth, &rsquo;twill certainly cure him.&nbsp; Would you so
contrive, in any way, to put it on him some time this
week?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Abbot answered, &lsquo;Bring him when you
will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Piovano thanked him and said: &lsquo;I will bring him
on Saturday, but when he shall be here, I pray you be at the gate
with seven or eight strong men, that he may not escape; for you
know, holy father, that these demoniacs are accustomed to rage
when they see relics and hear prayers, and it will be specially
so with this poor youth, who is young and vigorous&mdash;yea, it
may be that &rsquo;twill be necessary to give him sundry cuffs
and kicks, so terrible is the power of Satan&mdash;<!-- page
145--><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span><i>lupus esuriens</i>.&nbsp; Do so, I pray, without
fearing to hurt my feelings&mdash;nay, it would be a great
pleasure to me, so heartily do I desire to see him
cured.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Abbot answered, &lsquo;Bring him here, my son, and
I will see that all is rightly done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Piovano returned, saying to himself:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Chi vuol giusta vendetta,<br />
In Dio la metta.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Leave vengeance to the Lord, or to his
ministers&mdash;<i>videlicet</i>, the monks of San Miniato.&nbsp;
Which I will do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Friday he went to the merchant who had sold the
cloth, and said: &lsquo;As for this which I owe you, it is all
rubbish.&nbsp; You cheated the man who gave you the note out of
half the cloth&mdash;you know it, and I can prove it.&nbsp;
However, to avoid further trouble and litigation, I am willing to
pay all, but you must allow time for it.&nbsp; <i>Dura cosa e
l&rsquo;aspettare</i>&mdash;&rsquo;tis hard to wait, but harder
still to have nothing to wait for.&nbsp; The monks of San Miniato
owe me for forty cords of wood, which is to be paid for at the
end of two years, and then you shall have your money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This sounded like &lsquo;for ever and a day&rsquo; to
the creditor, and in a rage he had recourse to his collector, who
on Saturday morning went to San Miniato.&nbsp; When he arrived,
he had to wait till the grand mass was over, to the great
vexation of the young man, and meanwhile eight powerful monks
with long staves had grouped themselves about the door, awaiting
a little healthy exercise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mass being over, the dun hastened up to the Abbot,
who, taking him by the hand, said: &lsquo;Oh, my son, put thy
trust in God and in San Miniato the blessed; pray that he may
take this evil conceit from thy head,&rsquo; and with this much
more, till the young man grew impatient and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Messer Abbot, to-day is Saturday, and no time
for sermons.&nbsp; I have come to know what you are going to do
about this debt of Piovano of twenty-eight florins, and when it
will be paid?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the Abbot, hearing, as he expected, the demand for
money, began to exhort and exorcise.&nbsp; And the youth began to
abuse the Abbot with all kind of villanies, and finally turned to
depart; but the Abbot caught him by the cloak, and there was a
fight.&nbsp; Then came the eight monks, who seizing him,
chastised him lustily, and bound him with cords, and <!-- page
146--><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>bearing him into the sacristy, sprinkled him with holy
water, and incensed him indeed&mdash;and then set the holy head
of San Miniato on his head&mdash;he thinking they were all mad as
hatters.&nbsp; Then they exorcised the evil spirits in
him&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Maledicti</i>!<i> excommunicati et
rebelles&mdash;sitis in p&aelig;na &aelig;ternali nulla requies
sit in vo-o-o-bis si statim non eritis obedientes</i>,
<i>pr&aelig;ceptis me-e-e-e-is</i>!&rsquo;&mdash;until the youth
had to give in, and beg the Abbot&rsquo;s pardon, and being
released, fled as for dear life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he met outside Piovano Arlotto, who said to him:
&lsquo;Thou hast had a dainty drubbing, my son, but there is
plenty more where that came from&mdash;<i>non v&rsquo;e n&egrave;
fin</i>, <i>ne fondo</i>&mdash;there is neither end nor bottom to
it.&nbsp; Now go to thy master, and say that if he goes further
in this business he will fare worse than thou hast
done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The youth, returning to Florence, told the tale to his
employer, and how Piovano Arlotto had declared if they dunned him
any more he would do his best to have them drubbed to
death.&nbsp; So they dropped the matter&mdash;like a hot
shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody in Florence roared with laughter for seven
days&mdash;<i>sparsa la piacevolezza per Firenze</i>, <i>vi fu
che ridere per setti giorni</i>&mdash;that is to say, everybody
laughed except one clothmaker and his collector, and if they
smiled, &rsquo;twas sour and bitterly&mdash;the smile which does
not rise above the throat&mdash;the merriment like German
mourning grim.&nbsp; And as for the young man, he had to leave
Florence, for all of whom he would collect money told him to go
to&mdash;the monks of San Miniato!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There was a curious custom, from which came a proverb, in
reference to this monastery, which is thus narrated in that
singular work, <i>La Zucca del Doni Fiorentino</i> (&ldquo;The
Pumpkin of Doni the Florentine&rdquo;):</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There is a saying, <i>E non terrebbe un
cocomere all&rsquo;erta</i>&mdash;He could not catch a cucumber
if thrown to him.&nbsp; Well, ye must know, my masters and
gallant signors, that our Florentine youth in the season of
cucumbers go to San Miniato, where there is a steep declivity,
and when there, those who are above toss or roll them down to
those below, while those below throw them up to those above, just
as people play at toss-and-pitching oranges with girls at
windows.&nbsp; So they keep it up, and it is considered a great
shame and sign of feebleness <!-- page 147--><a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>(<i>dapocaggine</i>) not to be able to catch; and so in
declining the company of a duffer one says: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
have nothing to do with him&mdash;he isn&rsquo;t able to catch a
cucumber.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is one of the popular legends of this place that a
certain painter named Gallo di San Miniato was a terribly severe
critic of the works of others, but was very considerate as
regarded his own.&nbsp; And having this cast at him one day, and
being asked how it was, he frankly replied: &lsquo;I have but two
eyes wherewith to see my own pictures, but I look at those of
others with the hundred of Argus.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And indeed, as I record this, I cannot but think of a certain
famous critic who is so vain and captious that one must needs say
that his head, like a butterfly&rsquo;s, is all full of little
<i>i&rsquo;s</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And this tale of two optics reminds me of
the story of Messer Gismondo della Stufa, a Florentine of
Miniato, who once said to some friends: &lsquo;If I had devoted
myself to letters, I should have been twice as learned as others,
and yet ye cannot tell why.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then some guessed it
would have been due to a good memory, while others suggested
genius, but Messer Gismondo said: &lsquo;You are not there yet,
my children; it is because I am so confoundedly cross-eyed that I
could have read in two books at once.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the first legend which I narrated, the fall of the tower is
attributed to witchcraft or evil spirits.&nbsp; In the very
ancient frescoes of San Miniato there is one in which the devil
causes a wall or tower to fall down and crush a young monk.&nbsp;
What confirms the legend, or its antiquity, is that the original
bell-tower of San Miniato actually fell down in 1499.&nbsp; The
other then built was saved from a similar fate by the genius of
Michael Angelo Buonarotti, who built a bank of earth to support
it.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>H&aelig;c fabula</i> of the head of San
Miniato,&rdquo; wrote the immortal Flaxius on the proof,
&ldquo;teaches that he who would get round a priest in small
trickery must arise uncommonly early&mdash;nay, in most cases
&rsquo;twould be as well not to go to bed at all&mdash;especially
when dunning is &lsquo;on the tap.&rsquo;&nbsp; Concerning <!--
page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>which word <i>dun</i> it is erroneously believed in
England to have been derived from the name of a certain Joseph
Dunn, who was an indefatigable collecting bailiff.&nbsp; But in
very truth &rsquo;tis from the Italian <i>donare</i>, to give
oneself up to anything with ardour&mdash;to stick to it; in
accordance with which, <i>donar guanto</i>, or to give the glove,
means to promise to pay or give security.&nbsp; And if any
philologist differs from me in opinion as to this, why
then&mdash;<i>let</i> him diff!&nbsp; Which magnanimously
sounding conclusion, when translated according to the spirit of
most who utter it, generally means:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him be maledict, excommunicate, and damnated <i>ad
inferos&mdash;in s&aelig;cula s&aelig;culorum</i>!&mdash;twice
over!&rdquo;</p>

<h2><!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span

MARIA MAGGIORE&mdash;THE LADY WHO CONFESSED FOR
EVERYBODY&mdash;HOLY RELICS</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He who speaks from a window or a pulpit, or
the top of a good name or any high place, should speak wisely, if
he speak at all, unto those who pass.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Church of Santa Maria Maggiore &ldquo;remounts,&rdquo; as
the Italians say, or can be traced back to 700 <span
class="smcap">a.d.</span>, but it was enlarged and renewed by the
architect Bueno in the twelfth century, and according to
Pitr&eacute; it was the germ of a new style of architecture which
we find much refined (<i>ringentilata</i>) in Santa Maria del
Fiore.&nbsp; &ldquo;There were, regarding its bell-tower, which
no longer exists, many tales and curious anecdotes, which might
form a part of a fine collection of local legends.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There is still to-day on the wall above the little side-door
facing the Via de&rsquo; Conti, a much worn head of stone, coming
out of a round cornice, which is in all probability the one
referred to in the following legend:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was once a condemned criminal being carried along
to execution, and on the way passed before the Church of Santa
Maria Maggiore.&nbsp; One of the friars put his head out of a
little round window, which was just large enough for it to pass
through, and this was over the entrance on the lesser side of the
church, facing the Via de&rsquo; Conti.&nbsp; As the condemned
passed by the friar said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Date gli da bere, &rsquo;un morira
mai.&rsquo;<br />
&ldquo;&lsquo;Give him a drink and he never will die.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To which the condemned replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;E la testa di cost&igrave; tu
&rsquo;un la levrai&rsquo;.<br />
&ldquo;&lsquo;And thy head shall stick where it is for
aye.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>&ldquo;And so it came to pass that they could not get
the head of the friar back through the hole, so there he
died.&nbsp; And some say that after they got the body out they
carried his likeness in stone and put it there in the little
round window, in remembrance of the event, while others think
that it is the friar himself turned to stone&mdash;<i>chi
sa</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The conception of a stone head having been that of a person
petrified for punishment is of the kind which would spring up
anywhere, quite independently of tradition or borrowing; hence it
is found the world over.&nbsp; That ideas of the kind may be
common, yet not in common, nor yet uncommon, is shown by the
resemblance of the remark of the friar:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Give him a drink and he never will
die,&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which was as much as to say that inebriation would cause him
to forget his execution&mdash;to a verse of a song in &ldquo;Jack
Sheppard&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;For
nothing so calms,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our dolorous qualms,<br />
And nothing the transit to Tyburn beguiles,<br />
So well as a drink from the bowl of Saint Giles.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a merrier tale, however, of Santa Maria Maggiore, and
one which is certainly far more likely to have occurred than this
of the petrified <i>pater</i>.&nbsp; For it is told in the
ancient <i>Faceti&aelig;</i> that a certain Florentine nobleman,
who was a jolly and reckless cavalier, had a wife who, for all
her beauty, was <i>bisbetica e cattiva</i>, capricious and
spiteful, malicious and mischievous, a daughter of the devil, if
there ever was one, who, like all those of her kind, was very
devout, and went every day to confession in Santa Maria Maggiore,
where she confessed not only her own sins, but also those of all
her neighbours.&nbsp; And as she dwelt with vast eloquence on the
great wickedness of her husband&mdash;having a tongue which would
serve to sweep out an oven, or even a worse place <a
name="citation150"></a><a href="#footnote150"
class="citation">[150]</a>&mdash;the priest <!-- page 151--><a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>one day
urged the husband to come to confession, thinking that it might
lead to more harmony between the married couple.&nbsp; With which
he complied; but when the priest asked him to tell what sins he
had committed, the cavalier answered, &ldquo;There is no need of
it, Padre; you have heard them all from my wife many a time and
oft, and with them a hundred times as many which I never dreamed
of committing&mdash;including those of all Florence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was in the first Church of Santa Maria Maggiore, which
stood on the site of the present, that San Zenobio in the fourth
century had walled into the high altar an inestimable gift which
he had received from the Pope.&nbsp; This was &ldquo;the two
bodies of the glorious martyrs Abdon and Sennen, who had been
thrown unto wild beasts, which would not touch them, whereupon
they were put to death by swords in the hands of viler human
beasts.&rdquo;&nbsp; I may remark by the way, adds the observant
Flaxius, that relics have of late somewhat lost their value in
Florence.&nbsp; I saw not long ago for sale a very large silver
casket, stuffed full of the remains of the holiest saints, and
the certificates of their authenticity, and I was offered the
whole for the value of the silver in the casket&mdash;the relics
being generously thrown in!&nbsp; And truly the mass of old
bones, clay, splinters, nails, rags with blood, bits of wood,
dried-up eyes, <i>et cetera</i>, was precisely like the
Voodoo-box or conjuring bag of an old darkey in the United
States.&nbsp; But then the latter was heathen!&nbsp; &ldquo;That
is a <i>very</i> different matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The most striking object in the most remarkable part of
Florence is the colossal marble Neptune in the Fountain of the
Signoria, by Ammanati, dating from 1575.&nbsp; He stands in a
kind of car or box, drawn by horses which Murray declares
&ldquo;are exceedingly spirited.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are indeed
more so than he imagined, for according to popular belief, when
the spirit seizes them and their driver, and the bronze statues
round them, they all go careering off like mad beings over the
congenial Arno, and even on to the Mediterranean!&nbsp; That is
to say, that they did so on a time, till they were all petrified
with their driver in the instant when they were bounding like the
billows, which are typified by white horses.</p>
<p>Neptune has, however, lost his name for the multitude, who
simply call him the Biancone, or Great White Man; and this is the
legend (given to me in writing by a witch), by which he is
popularly known:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Biancone, the
God of the Arno</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Biancone was a great and potent man, held in great
respect for his grandeur and manly presence, a being of
tremendous strength, and the true type of a magician, <a
name="citation152"></a><a href="#footnote152"
class="citation">[152]</a> he <!-- page 153--><a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>being a
wizard indeed.&nbsp; In those days there was much water in the
Arno, <a name="citation153"></a><a href="#footnote153"
class="citation">[153]</a> and Biancone passed over it in his
car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was then in the Arno a witch, a beautiful girl,
the <i>vera dea</i> or true goddess of the river, in the form of
an eel.&nbsp; And Biancone finding this fish every day as he
drove forth in his chariot, spurned it away <i>con cattivo
garbo</i>&mdash;with an ill grace.&nbsp; And one day when he had
done this more contemptuously than usual, the eel in a rage
declared she would be revenged, and sent to him a smaller
eel.&nbsp; But Biancone crushed its head (<i>le stiaccio il
chapo</i>).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the eel appeared with a little branch of olive
with berries, and said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Entro in questa carozza,<br />
Dove si trove l&rsquo;uomo,<br />
L&rsquo;uomo il pi&ugrave; potente,<br />
Che da tutti e temuto;<br />
Ed e un uomo grande,<br />
E grande, e ben vero;<br />
Ma il gran dio del Arno,<br />
Il potente Biancone,<br />
Non sara il solo potente;<br />

Io una piccola anguillina,<br />
Sono una vera fata,<br />

Tu credevi d&rsquo;essere<br />
Il solo dio d&rsquo;Arno,<br />
Ma ci, no, io che sono<br />
La regina, e la vera,<br />
Vera dea qui del Arno.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Lo, I enter in this chariot!<br />
Where I find the man of power,<br />
Who is feared by all before him,<br />
And he is a mighty being,<br />
Great he is, there&rsquo;s no denying;<br />
But the great god of the Arno,<br />
The so powerful Biancone,<br />
Is not all alone in power;<br />
There&rsquo;s a little fish or eel, who,<br />
<!-- page 154--><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Mighty man, to make thee tremble!<br />
Biancone, thou art only<br />

I, a little eel of the Arno,<br />
Am the fairy of the river;<br />
Thou didst deem thyself its ruler;<br />
I deny it&mdash;for I only<br />
Am the queen and the true goddess&mdash;<br />
The true goddess of the Arno.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Having said this, she touched with the twig of olive
the little eel whom Biancone had killed, and repeated while
touching it:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Anguillina che dal Grande<br />
Siei stata stiacciata,<br />
Io con questo ramoscello<br />
Ti faccio in vita tornare,<br />
E al Grande, io, del Arno<br />
Tutto il mio pensiero,<br />

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I, little eel, who by the mighty<br />
Man hast been to death delivered,<br />
Do call thee back unto the living!<br />
Wake thee with this twig of olive!<br />
Now unto this Biancone,<br />
Thou who art too of the Arno,<br />
Shalt speak out thy mind and freely.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Then the little eel, resuscitated and influenced by the
goddess of the Arno, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Biancone, tu che siei<br />
Il potente dio dell&rsquo; Arno,<br />
L&rsquo;anguilla discacciata,<br />
Che tu ai discacciata,<br />
E di te inamorata,<br />
E di te pi&ugrave; potente,<br />
E se tu la discaccerai,<br />
Ti giura la vendetta,<br />
E si vendichera. . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Biancone, Biancone!<br />
Thou great spirit of the Arno,<br />
Lo, the eel by thee despised<br />
Turns again with love unto thee:<br />
She surpasses thee in power;<br />
If she is by thee rejected,<br />
She will vow revenge upon thee,<br />
And will be aveng&egrave;d truly.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>&ldquo;Biancone replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Io non voglio amar donne,<br />

<p>&ldquo;Then the eel arose <a name="citation155"></a><a

Ma che ora sono io,<br />
Che ti discaccio per la tua,<br />
Al te si guardami mi vedi.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Biancone, now regard me,<br />
Look well at me now, for never,<br />
Wilt thou ever more behold me,<br />
Or if thou behold&rsquo;st me, touch me,<br />
And thou say&rsquo;st that thou hast power,<br />
And that none can rival with thee.<br />
Thou shalt learn that I am stronger,<br />
For I&rsquo;ve power to make thee love me,<br />
But &rsquo;tis I who now reject thee,<br />
If thou doubtest&mdash;now behold me!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And then, instead of an eel, appeared a maid of
dazzling <!-- page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>beauty, and Biancone sought to
embrace her, but could not, and said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Contentami una volta<br />
Sola, o dea dell&rsquo; Arno;<br />
Lascia che ti abbraci<br />
Una volta sola, o dea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;For a single time content me,<br />
Lovely goddess of the Arno;<br />
Let me but for once embrace thee,<br />
Yield to me I pray, O fairy!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;But the goddess of the Arno replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Una donna pi&ugrave; potente<br />
Di te, non si lascia<br />
Vincere da uno superbo;<br />
Tuo pari mi basta di<br />
Far ti vedere, che c&rsquo;e<br />
Persona ancora di te<br />
Pi&ugrave; potente . . .&nbsp; Ora io<br />
Mi voglio vendi care per che,<br />
Tu mi ai discacciata,<br />
Tante volte, ed ora invece<br />
Tu saresti bene contento<br />
Di abbraciarmi anche,<br />
Anche or per una volta,<br />
Ma no.&nbsp; Addio Biancone!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A woman who has greater power<br />
Than thine will surely not be conquered<br />
Merely by pride in outward seeming,<br />
But now, in brief, I will content me<br />
By proving mine the greater power;<br />
I seek to avenge myself upon thee,<br />
Since of old thou didst despise me<br />
Many times, but now wouldst gladly,<br />
Though it were but for once, embrace me&mdash;<br />
Farewell for ever, Biancone!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And Biancone fled, but he always bore the beautiful
goddess in his mind, and could not forget her, so he too
meditated a vengeance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the vengeance of a woman strikes more powerfully
than that of a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day when Biancone was passing over the Arno in his
chariot, with all his attendants, he thought he saw the eel
engaged in forming the basin of a fountain (<i>vasca</i>), and
bear it away in a car, she herself being in it, <a
name="citation156"></a><a href="#footnote156"
class="citation">[156]</a> and it was covered <!-- page 157--><a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>with glass;
but in the time that he thought (or dreamed) that he saw this,
the eel appeared and said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Il momenta della mia vendetta<br />
E arrivato, e ti giuro<br />
Giuro che la mia vendetta<br />
E potente, or Turanna,<br />
Mia regina delle Fate,<br />
E dea dell Arno, commanda<br />
Che questa carroza sprafondi,<br />
E che tu e la tua servitu,<br />
Non vi potrete salvare.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now the time to wreak my vengeance<br />
Has arrived, and I swear thee<br />
That my vengeance shall be fearful,<br />
Very great, because my sovereign,<br />
Turanna, queen of all the fairies,<br />
Orders that thy chariot<br />
Shall be firmly fixed for ever,<br />
And that thou and all thy following<br />
Never more canst hope for rescue.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Then she sang again:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Confino i tuoi servitori,<br />
Quelli che ti aiut avanno<br />
A discacciar sui, o<br />
Diventare della forma,<br />
Mezze bestie, mezzi uomini,<br />
E tu o Biancone,<br />
Che tanto grande siei,<br />
Ti confino a stare sempre,<br />
Sempre ritto e non potrete<br />
Mai ragionare, ne camminare<br />
Solo quando sara luna,<br />
Luna piena, passero io<br />
Ti vedro, e mi vedrai,<br />
Ma parlarmi non potrai.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Quando sara luna piena,<br />
E che sara una notte,<br />
Che sara mezza nuvola,<br />
E mezza serena s&rsquo;enderai,<br />
Della tua carozza nei,<br />
Nei momenti che la Luna<br />
Resta sotto le nuvole,<br />
E cosi potrei favellare,<br />
Con tutte le statue, che ai<br />
Attorno, allor tua carozza,<br />
E col mio permesso potrai<br />
Andare anche dai tuoi amici!&rsquo;</p>

As for thee, O Biancone!<br />
Thou who art so tall and stately,<br />
Thou shalt stand erect for ever,<br />
Without power to speak or wander,<br />
Only when the full moon shining<br />

I shall see thee; thou will see me,<br />
Without power to address me!</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When the moon in full is shining,<br />
Yet when clouds begin to gather;<br />
Half in light and half in darkness,<br />
Thou may&rsquo;st only in the moment<br />
When the moon is overclouded,<br />

<p>I may here explain to the reader that this tale with its
elaborate invocations is not current as here given among the
<i>people</i>.&nbsp; Such forms and formulas are confined to the
witches, who, as in all countries, are the keepers of mysterious
traditions.&nbsp; All that is generally heard as regards this
subject is, that when the full moon shines on Biancone at
midnight, he becomes animated, and walks about the Signoria
conversing with the other statues.</p>
<p>The Neptune was, with horses and all, produced by Bartolommeo
Ammanati between 1564 and 1565.&nbsp; It has a certain merit of
grandeur, but in lesser degree is like its neighbour Cacus, by
Baccio Bandinelli, which Benvenuto Cellini justly regarded as
resembling a mere bag of fat.&nbsp; When Michael Angelo saw the
Neptune he exclaimed: &ldquo;Ammanato!&nbsp; Ammanato! che bel
blocco che hai sciupato!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Ammanato, what a
fine block of marble thou hast spoiled!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Italians say that the satyr at the corner of the Palazzo
Vecchio is a copy, because the original was stolen <!-- page
159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>one night in January in 1821, &ldquo;and is now one of
the finest bronzes in the British Museum of London.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It may be so; there was a great deal of fine stealing in those
days.&nbsp; I suspect, however, that the truth is that as these
images return to life now and then, the satyr availed himself of
his revivification to set forth on his travels, and coming to
London and finding good company in the British Museum, settled
down there.&nbsp; But truly, when I think of the wanton and
heartless destruction of beautiful and valuable old relics which
has gone on of late years in Florence, to no earthly purpose, and
to no profit whatever, I feel as if all the tales of such things
being stolen or sold away to foreign museums were supremely
silly, and as if it were all just so much saved from
ruin&mdash;in case the tales are true.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>H&aelig;c fabula docet</i>,&rdquo; wrote
Flaxius, &ldquo;a strange lesson.&nbsp; For as it was anciently
forbidden to make images, because it was an imitation of
God&rsquo;s work; and secondly, because men believed that spirits
would enter into them&mdash;even so doth it become all
novel-writers, romancers, and poets, to take good heed how they
portray satyrs, free-love nymphs, and all such deviltry, because
they may be sure that into these models or types there will enter
many a youthful soul, who will be led away thereby to madness and
ruin.&nbsp; Which is, I take it, the most practical explanation
for commandment, which hath been as yet set <i>coram
populo</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lord Foulis in his castle sat,<br />
And beside him old Red-cap sly;<br />
&lsquo;Now tell me, thou sprite, who art mickle of might,<br />
The death which I shall die?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Scott&rsquo;s</span> <i>Border Minstrelsy</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bargello has been truly described as one of the most
interesting historical monuments of Florence, and it is a very
picturesque type of a towered medi&aelig;val palace.&nbsp; It was
partly burned down in 1322, and rebuilt in its present form by
Neri di Fioravanti, after which it served as a prison.&nbsp;
Restored, or modernised, it is now a museum.&nbsp; As I
conjectured, there was some strange legend connected with it, and
this was given to me as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Il Folletto
Rosso</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Red Goblin is a spirit who haunts the Bargello, or
was there of old in the prisons, <i>nelle carceri</i>, and he
always foretold to every prisoner what his sentence would be
before it was pronounced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He always appeared in the cell of the condemned, and
first lighting a candle, showed himself all clad in red, and said
to the prisoner:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Piangi, piangi, ma piangi forte,<br
/>
E prepararti che e giunta<br />
L&rsquo;ora della tua morte.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Weep, oh weep full many a tear;<br />
Make ready; thy hour for death is near.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Then if the prisoner replied boldly:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Anima chi siei!<br />
Ti preg&ograve; di volermi aiutare<br />
A liberarmi dalla morte!&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Spirit, whoe&rsquo;er thou be,<br />
I beg thee now for aid;<br />
From death pray set me free!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the goblin would burst into a laugh and say:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Non piangere, ridi, ridi!<br />
Ma ride sempre, e spera<br />
Che io ti aiutera!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;But if the prisoner had replied badly, or cursed, or
said &lsquo;<i>Vai al diavolo</i>!&rsquo; or &lsquo;<i>Che il
diavolo ti porti</i>!&rsquo;&mdash;then there were heard dreadful
sounds, such as frightened all the prisoners and assistants, and
the goblin vanished crying:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Woe, woe, and woe to thee!<br />
For thou soon shalt punished be;<br />
Away be led, to lose your head,<br />
There is no hope for thee!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And after that the man might well despair.&nbsp; Yet
the Red Goblin was a jolly sprite when not crossed, and made
great sport for the prisoners, who all knew him.&nbsp; He went
into every cell, and would tell wild tales, and relate to every
one all that he, the prisoner, had done since he was a boy, and
how he came to be locked up, and what would be the end of it, and
told all this with such peals of laughter that the most unhappy
were fain to laugh with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the assistants and the director hearing such
sounds, thought it was the prisoners rioting, but could not
detect them. <a name="citation161a"></a><a href="#footnote161a"
class="citation">[161a]</a>&nbsp; And the spirit relieved many
innocent men from punishment, and especially visited those
condemned to wear the iron collar or <i>gogna</i>, which was
fastened to a post, but at the Bargello it was on the Campanile
outside, in sight of all the people. <a
name="citation161b"></a><a href="#footnote161b"
class="citation">[161b]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Now there was a young man in the prison who was good at
heart, and deeply repented that he had done wrong, and now feared
that he indeed was in the power of Satan, and destined to be in
prison for all this life and in <i>inferno</i> all the next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when he was thus sunk in misery one night, he heard
him, and was in great alarm, but it said, &lsquo;Fear <!-- page
162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>not, for I am the protecting spirit of the prisoners in
the Bargello, and have come to free thee; put thy trust in me and
I will save thee!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he told the youth how he was to act, and bade him
say certain things when examined, and follow closely all the
goblin would whisper to him; but whether it was his fault or his
failure, he missed every point and went wrong in his replies, the
end being that he was condemned to prison for life.&nbsp; Truly
it went to his heart to think that while he lived he should
always see the sun looking like a chess-board, <a
name="citation162"></a><a href="#footnote162"
class="citation">[162]</a> and bitterly reflected on the
proverb:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ne a torto n&egrave; a ragione,<br
/>
Non ti lasciar metter prigione.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Whether you&rsquo;re right or wrong, my man,<br
/>
Keep out of prison as long as you can.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;But it went most bitterly to his heart to think that he
had by his own stupidity and want of study lost the chance of
freedom.&nbsp; And for some time the Red Goblin never came near
him.&nbsp; But at last the prisoner heard him call, and then the
spirit said, &lsquo;Now thou see&rsquo;st to what a pass thy
neglect of my advice has brought thee.&nbsp; Truly <i>il diavolo
non ti tenterebbe</i>&mdash;the devil takes no pains to tempt
such a fool as thou, for he knows that he will get him without
the trouble of asking.&nbsp; And yet I will give thee one more
chance, and this time be thou wide awake and remember that <i>a
buona volont&agrave;</i>, <i>non manca
facolt&aacute;</i>&mdash;where there&rsquo;s a will there&rsquo;s
a way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now there was a great lord and mighty man of the state
who had been in the Bargello, and greatly comforted by the Red
Goblin, who now went unto this Signore, speaking so well of the
young man that the latter ere long had a new trial.&nbsp; And
this time, I warrant you, he studied his case like a lawyer; for
<i>asino punto</i>, <i>convien che trott&egrave;</i>&mdash;when
an ass is goaded he must needs trot&mdash;and the end thereof was
that he trotted out of prison, and thence into the world, and
having learned repentance as well as the art of watching his wits
and turning them to account, prospered mightily, and to his dying
day never forgot to pray for the Red Goblin of the
Bargello.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There have been other spirits which haunted prisons; there was
one in the Bastile, and the White Ladies of <!-- page 163--><a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>Berlin and
Parma are of their kind.&nbsp; This of the Bargello is certainly
the household sprite with the red cap, in a short shirt, who was
very well known to the Etruscans and Romans, and afterwards to
the Germans, the <i>Lutin</i> of the French castles, the Robin
Goodfellow of England, and the Domovoy of the Russians.&nbsp; His
characteristics are reckless good nature mingled with mischief
and revenge; but he is always, when not thwarted, at heart a
<i>bon gar&ccedil;on</i>.&nbsp; Of the Bargello I have also the
following anecdotes or correlative incidents:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Giorgio</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly I will not swear that this is a story of the
Bargello, for I am very particular as to truth, Signore, but I
will swear that &rsquo;tis of a prison in Florence, and that when
it happened the Bargello was the only prison there.&nbsp; And it
runs thus: Giorgio, whoever he was, had killed a man, and as the
law ran in his case, in those strange days, he could not be
executed till he had confessed or owned the deed.&nbsp; And he
would not confess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now there was a lawyer, <i>un notaio</i>, <i>&ograve;
chi che si fosse</i> (or whoever he was), who declared that he
would bring to pass with a trick what justice had not been able
to do with torture.&nbsp; So going to the prison, he called for
wine, and when they had drunk deep he cried heartily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Ors&uacute;</i>, <i>Giorgio</i>, <i>stiamo un
poco allegri</i>, <i>cantiam qualche
cosa</i>&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Come now, Giorgio, let&rsquo;s be
merry and sing something!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Come ti piace</i>&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;As you
please,&rsquo; quoth Master Giorgio.&nbsp; &lsquo;You sing one
line.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the notary began, touching a lute:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Giorgi h&agrave; morto
l&rsquo;huomo.&rsquo;<br />
&ldquo;&lsquo;Giorgio once killed a man.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To which Giorgio, who was sharp as a razor, added:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cos&igrave; non canta
Giorgio.&rsquo;<br />
&ldquo;&lsquo;But it was not thus that Giorgio sang.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;So it passed into a proverb, meaning as much as
<i>Cos&igrave; non dico io</i>&mdash;I don&rsquo;t say that; or
<i>Cos&igrave; non l&rsquo;intendo io</i>&mdash;I don&rsquo;t see
<!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>it in that light.&nbsp; And so the notary found that
you cannot see Verona from the top of every hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there is another story of a prisoner, who had long
curling hair in the old Florentine style.&nbsp; Hair, Signore,
like charity, may cover much sin.&nbsp; Now this man, after he
had been a while in the Bargello, got his sentence, which was to
have his ears cropped off.&nbsp; But when the <i>boia</i> or
hangman came to do the job, he found that the man had had his
ears cut off smooth long before.&nbsp; Whence came the
proverb:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Quel che havea mozzi gli orecchi,<br
/>
E&rsquo;ci sara de gli arreticati.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He whose ears had been cut away,<br />
Fooled another, or so they say.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is a proverb to this day, when a man finds that somebody
has been before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it may have been that Donatello, the great
sculptor, was in the Bargello when he said,
&lsquo;<i>E&rsquo;rise a me ed io riso &agrave;
lui</i>&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;He laughs at me, and I do laugh at
him.&rsquo;&nbsp; Donatello was <i>in quistione</i>, or in
trouble with the law, and in prison, for having killed one of his
pupils.&nbsp; The Marquis di Ferrara asked him if he was
guilty.&nbsp; But Donatello had already received from the Marquis
a license to slay any one in self-defence, and so he made that
answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">A Legend of the
Bargello</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day a young man, who had been gaming and lost,
threw some dirt at an image of the Virgin in one of the numerous
shrines in the city, blaming her for his bad luck.&nbsp; He was
observed by a boy, who reported it to the authorities, and was
soon arrested.&nbsp; Having confessed that he did it in a rage at
having lost, he was hanged the same night from one of the windows
of the Bargello.&rdquo; <a name="citation164"></a><a
href="#footnote164" class="citation">[164]</a></p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Thereby adding another ghost or <i>folletto</i> to those who
already haunt the place.&nbsp; It should be noted that according
to Italian witch-lore a ghost is never simply the spirit of the
departed as he <i>was</i>, but a spirit transformed.&nbsp; A
witch becomes a <i>fata</i>, good or bad, and all men something
more than they were.</p>
<p><!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>Among other small legends or tales in which the
Bargello is referred to, I find the following, of which I must
first mention that <i>debito</i> in Italian means not only debt
but duty, and that <i>fare un debito</i> is not only to get into
debt, but to do what is just, upright, and honourable.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It happened once, long ago, that a certain
good fellow was being escorted, truly not by a guard of honour,
but by several bum-bailiffs, to the Bargello, and met a friend
who asked him why he was in custody.&nbsp; To which he replied,
&lsquo;Other men are arrested and punished for crime or villainy,
but I am treated thus for having acted honourably, <i>per aver
fatto il debito mio</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it happened to this same man that after he had been
entertained for a time at the public expense in that <i>gran
albergo</i>, or great hotel, the Bargello, that the Council of
Eight, or the public magistracy, gave him a hearing, and told him
that he must promptly pay the debt which he owed, which was one
of fifty <i>scudi</i> or crowns.&nbsp; To which he replied that
he could not.&nbsp; Then the chief of the Eight said, &lsquo;We
will find out a way to make you pay it, be sure of
that.&rsquo;&nbsp; To which he answered, &lsquo;<i>De gratia</i>,
<i>Signore</i>, while you are about it, then, make it a hundred,
for I have great need just now of another fifty
crowns.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prisoners in the Bargello, as elsewhere, were subject to the
most appalling injustice and cruelty.&nbsp; Thus we are told of
Cosimo di Medici, when he was doing all in his power to
assassinate or poison Piero Strozzi, that he was always very
circumspect as regarded the venom, &ldquo;and did not use it till
he had studied the effects and doses on condemned prisoners in
the Bargello.&rdquo;&nbsp; But &ldquo;condemned prisoners&rdquo;
here means doubtless those who were simply condemned to be made
the subjects of such experiments, as may be supposed, when we
learn that Cosimo obtained the recipe of making up a poison from
Messer Apollino, secretary of Piero Luigi, by <i>torturing</i>
him.&nbsp; It was thus they did in good old pious times.&nbsp;
Poisoning, as a most familiar and frequent thing, even in
England, did not pass <!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>out of practice, even in politics,
until that great beginning of a moral era, the Reformation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>H&aelig;c fabula docet</i>,&rdquo; wrote the good
and wise Flaxius on the revise, &ldquo;that as a <i>Zoccolone</i>
friar is the best priest for a peasant, so even a <i>buon
diavolo</i>, or jolly devil, or a boon blackguard who knows his
men, is, perhaps, generally the best guide for certain kinds of
rough sinners, often setting them aright in life where a holy
saint would be <i>inter sacrem et saxum</i>, or in despair.&nbsp;
As for poisoning, I fear <i>that</i> cup, far from passing away,
is, under another form, passed round far more frequently now than
it ever was.&nbsp; For Fran&ccedil;ois Villon declared that lying
gossip, tittle-tattle, and second-hand slander were worse than
poison (which simply kills the body), and this with infinite
refinement prevails far more in modern society (being aided by
newspapers) than it ever did of yore anywhere.&nbsp; <i>This</i>
is the poison of the present day, which has more
<i>venefic&aelig;</i> to spread it than the Locustan or Borgian
venoms ever found.&nbsp; Now for a merrier tale!&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If all that&rsquo;s written, talked or
sunge<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Must be of the follies of menne,<br />
&rsquo;Twere better that no one moved his tongue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or that none could use a penne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jog on, jog on the footpath-waye,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And cheerily jump the stile;<br />
A merry heart goes all the daye,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A sad one tires in a mile!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The celebrated Church of San Lorenzo is a grand museum of art,
even among the many of its kind in Florence.&nbsp; It was
originally a Roman Christian basilica, built by the matron
Giuliana, which edifice was consecrated <span
class="smcap">a.d.</span> 373 by Saint Ambrose, and called the
Basilica Ambrosiana.&nbsp; It was partially rebuilt by
Brunelleschi in 1435, and completed with sad alteration, and
finished by Antonio Manetti.&nbsp; As is well known, or has been
made known by many great poets, it contains the grandest statuary
by Michael Angelo in its monuments of Lorenzo de&rsquo; Medici
and his uncle Giuliano.</p>
<p>This church served as a sanctuary in the olden time, and of
this there is a tale told in the old collections of
faceti&aelig;, which, though trifling, is worth recalling as
connected with it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Il
Debitore</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Messer Paolo dell&rsquo; Ottonaio, a Canon of San
Lorenzo in Florence, a cheerful and facetious man, found a
certain citizen one of his friends, who had taken refuge as a
debtor in the church; and the latter stood in sorrowful and
pensive attitude, having in no wise the appearance of one who had
found <!-- page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>a treasure, or who was going to be
married, or to dine with the Duke, or anything of the kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Man, what aileth thee?&rsquo; cried the
Canon.&nbsp; &lsquo;Has thy wife beaten thee, or the cat broken
thy best crockery, or thy favourite housemaid run
away?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What I have,&rsquo; replied the poor man,
&lsquo;is ten times worse than all that put
together.&rsquo;&nbsp; And so, <i>havendo caro di sfogarsi</i>,
being glad to relieve himself, he told Messer Paolo all his
sorrows, wailing that his creditors, having taken all his
property, threatened his person, swearing that they would put him
in the <i>Stinche</i>, which was so horrible a prison that it was
infamous even then all the world over as an <i>inferno</i> where
every one confined at once became <i>infermo</i>, or a hell which
made men ill, and that, being in despair, he would have taken his
own life had he not come across a charming book on patience which
had consoled him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Messer Paolo asked him whether the creditors had been
paid in full.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Alas, no!&rsquo; replied the debtor; &lsquo;not
one half; nor will they ever get the rest, for I have
naught.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In that case,&rsquo; answered the Canon,
&lsquo;it seems to me that it is your creditors and not you who
should read that charming book, since it is evident that, as they
are to have nothing till the Greek Kalends, or on Saint
Never&rsquo;s day, that they must have patience whether they will
or no.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as the saying is, <i>Pazienza vince scienza</i>
(Patience beats knowledge), and <i>Chi ha pazienza vede le sue
vendette</i> (Wait long enough and you&rsquo;ll get your
revenges), the Canon got for the poor man money enough to make a
composition with his creditors, and he, having expectations which
they knew not of, compounded with them for five per cent., on
conditions written, that he should pay all up &lsquo;as he earned
more money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so he was set free, and it befell on a day that
some relation died and left him a fortune, whereupon his
creditors summoned him to pay his old debts, which he refused to
do.&nbsp; Then they cited him before the Council as a fraudulent
debtor, but he replied by showing his quittance or agreement, and
declared that he was only obliged to pay out of his
<i>earnings</i>, and that he had inherited his money and not
earned it.&nbsp; Whereupon there was great dispute, and one of
the creditors who had shown himself most unfeeling and inhuman
protested that to get money in any way whatever was to
<i>guadagnare</i> (a gain by labour), since it was labour even to
put it in one&rsquo;s <!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>pocket.&nbsp; Now, this man had a
handsome wife, who, it was generally known, greatly enriched her
husband by dishonouring him, at which he willingly winked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whereupon the debtor asked the magistrate if an ox
carried off a bundle of hay on his horns, which had by chance
been stuck into it, he could be said to have earned it by honest
labour?&nbsp; At which there was such a roar of laughter, and so
many cries of &lsquo;No! no! no!&rsquo; that the court went no
further, and acquitted the culprit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There is an odd bit of folklore attached to this church.&nbsp;
As may be supposed, and as I have frequently verified, &ldquo;the
idle repetition of vain words,&rdquo; as the heathen do, or
prayers in a language which people do not understand, generally
lead to most ridiculous perversions of the unknown tongue.&nbsp;
A popular specimen of this is the <i>Salve Regina delle Ciane
Fiorentine di San Lorenzo</i>, or the &ldquo;<i>Salve Regina</i>
of the Florentine women of the lower class, as given in San
Lorenzo.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Ciana</i> is given by Barretti as a
specially Florentine word.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">La Salve
Regina</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sarvia della Regina, dreco la Misericordia, vita
d&rsquo;un cieco, spezia nostra, sarvia tua, te chiamao esule,
fili e vacche!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ate sospirao, i&rsquo; gemeo fetente in barca e lacrima

<p>&ldquo;L&rsquo; la eggo educata nostra, <i>illons in

<p>&ldquo;Misericordia se&rsquo; cieli e in ossi e coperte, e
lesine benedette, frutti, ventri, tubi, novi, posti cocche,
esilio e tende!</p>
<p>&ldquo;O crema, o pia, o dorce virgola
Maria!&mdash;Ammenne!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>This is perfectly in the spirit of the Middle Ages, of which
so much is still found in the cheapest popular Italian
literature.&nbsp; I have elsewhere mentioned that it was long
before the Reformation, when the Church was at the height of her
power, that blasphemies, travesties of religious services, and
scathing sarcasms of monkish life reached their extreme, and were
never equalled afterwards, even by Protestant satirists.&nbsp;
The <i>Epistol&aelig; Obscurorum Virorum</i> of H&uuml;tten and
Reuchlin was an <!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>avowed caricature by an enemy.&nbsp;
The revelations of monkish life by Boccaccio, Cintio, Arlotto,
and a hundred other good Catholics, were a thousand times more
damaging than the <i>Epistol&aelig;</i>, because they were the
unconscious betrayals of friends.</p>
<p>Since writing the foregoing, I have obtained the following,
entitled, <i>The Pater Noster of the Country People in the Old
Market</i>, or,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Il Pater Noster
dei Beceri di Mercato</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pate nostro quisin celi sanctifice tuore nome tumme;
avvenia regno tumme; fia te volunta stua, in celo en terra.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pane nostro cotediano da nobis sodie, e dimitti nobis
debita nostra, sicutte ette nos dimittimus debitori nostri, sette
ananossie in due casse, intenzione sedie nosse e
mulo.&mdash;Amenne!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There is, however, this great difference in the two prayers
here given, that the <i>Salve Regina</i> is intended for a jest,
while the paternoster is given as actually taken down from a
<i>ciana</i>, and is rather a specimen of dialect than a <i>jeu
d&rsquo;esprit</i>.&nbsp; The following <i>Ave Maria</i> is also
serious, and simply a curiosity of language:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">L&rsquo;Ave
Maria</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Avemmaria grazia piena, domin&ograve; teco beneditta e
frustris, e mulieri busse e benedetti fruttus ventris tui
eiusse!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Santa Maria Materdei, ora pro nobisse, pecatoribusse,
tinche, tinona, mortis nostrisse.&mdash;Ammenne!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>These specimens of Italianised Latin are not so grotesque as
some which were written out for me in all seriousness by a poor
woman.&nbsp; A specimen of the latter is given in my work on
&ldquo;Etruscan-Roman Traditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Last of all, there came to me a small tale of little value,
save that it professes to account for the reason why so many cats
have ever flourished and been nourished in <!-- page 171--><a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>the
cloister of San Lorenzo, these felines being, indeed, in a small
way among the lions of Florence.&nbsp; It is as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">I Gatti di San
Lorenzo</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the cloisters of San Lorenzo there are many cats,
and every evening people may be seen who go there to feed them,
among whom are many old men and women.&nbsp; But these cats were
long ago themselves human, that is to say, they were once all
wizards and witches, who bear their present form for punishment
of an evil deed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was once a very wealthy and powerful family in
Florence, at the head of which was a gentleman and lady who had
an only daughter, in whom was all their love and hope.&nbsp;
Among their servants in a higher position was an old woman, who
was very vindictive and easily offended, so that she could brood
over deadly revenge for years for the least affront, and she
fancied she had a great many, because when she had neglected her
duty at times she had been scolded by her mistress or master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now this old woman knew that death or disaster to the
daughter would drive the parents mad; and so having recourse to
witchcraft, she put into the drink of the young lady a decoction,
the result of which was that she began to waste away, growing
weaker and paler, without feeling any pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then her parents, in great fear, consulted the best
physicians, who did no good, for indeed it was a case beyond
their skill.&nbsp; And at last, beginning to believe that there
was something unearthly in it all, they sent for an old woman who
cured by occult art. <a name="citation171"></a><a
href="#footnote171" class="citation">[171]</a>&nbsp; And when she
came she looked steadily at the girl, then frowned and shook her
head, and asked for a ribbon or cord, no matter what, so that it
were one which the young lady had worn about her waist.&nbsp;
With this she measured accurately the height of the patient from
head to foot, and then the width from hand to hand, it being
desirous that the arms be of equal length; but there was the
disproportion of the thickness of a piece of money.&nbsp; Then
the witch said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This is none of my affair as regards the
cure.&nbsp; Your daughter is bewitched, and I can indeed make the
witch appear, but to beat her and compel her to remove the spell
depends on you alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>&ldquo;Now they, suspecting the old servant, sent for
her, but she had disappeared and could not be found.&nbsp; Then
the doctress took a caldron, and put into it hot water and the
undergarments of the girl and certain herbs, and boiled them all
together, singing an incantation, and, taking a knife, sharpened
it on the table, whetting it on the chemise of the young
lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the old servant woman appeared at the door,
against her will, forced by the power of the spell, in an agony
of rage and bitterness; but she was at once seized and beaten,
whereupon she consented to unbewitch the girl, who speedily
recovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now Florence was at that time fearfully afflicted with
evil witches, who defied all authority, and spread disease and
death far and wide; but this affair of the bewitched lady being
made known, both priests and laymen rose up in wrath, and the
sorceress fled for sanctuary to the cloisters of San Lorenzo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then to save their lives the <i>Strege</i> made a
compromise with the priests, and it was agreed that they should
no longer live as witches, or do any harm, but all live and die
as cats in the cloister, where they should be regularly fed, and
exist in peace.&nbsp; Which agreement has been duly carried out
to this day, and among these cats are many who were once witches
in human form hundreds of years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>This narrative is not so much a story as an account of the
manner in which bewitchment is undone by another witch.&nbsp; The
reader will find the incantations in the chapter entitled
&ldquo;The Spell of the Boiling Clothes,&rdquo; in my work on
&ldquo;Etruscan-Roman Remains.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of the most
serious riots which has occurred in Milan for many years took
place March 3, 1891, when the populace tortured terribly and
tried to kill a witch, who had, it was believed, been detected by
this spell.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>H&aelig;c fabula docet</i>,&rdquo; adds the wise
Flaxius, &ldquo;this story suggests a reason why a certain kind
of ladies of ecclesiastical proclivities are always called
tabbies.&nbsp; And that there is something in it I can well
believe, knowing one who, when she calls her rector or bishop
&lsquo;<i>De-ar man</i>!&rsquo; does so in a manner <!-- page
173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>which marvellously suggests the purring of a cat.&nbsp;
And the manner in which the tabby pounces on the small birds,
mice, and gold-fish of others&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, their
peccadilloes, and small pets or pleasures, which in good faith do
her no harm&mdash;seems like literally copying the
feline&mdash;upon line. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! ye who visit the cloister, and see the cats, think
well on this legend, and especially on the deep identity of
witches with tabbies!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for a moral, note that, with all their sins, what
the witches and cats aimed at above all things was <i>food</i>,
with which they have remained content, according to the exquisite
lyric by the divine Shelley, p. 661, Dowden&rsquo;s
edition:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This poor little cat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Only wanted a rat,<br />
To stuff out its own little maw,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And it were as good<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people had such food<br />
To make them <i>hold their jaw</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For by diabolical art he assumed varied
forms, even the human, and deceived people by many occult
tricks.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Fromann</span>,
<i>Tractatus de Fascinatione</i>, 1675.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a slight tale of light value, and not new, but it has
assumed local colour, and may amuse the reader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a great art of witches and sorcerers of old to
give a man or woman by art the appearance of another person, and
this they called &lsquo;drawing white lines with charcoal,&rsquo;
and there is many a fine tale about it.&nbsp; Now it was about
the time when Berta spun and owls wore silk cloaks that a Signore
Nannincino lived in the old Piazza San Biagio.&nbsp; He had many
small possessions in Florence, but the roast chickens of the
supper, or his great piece, was an estate in the country called
the Mula a Quinto, for which all his relations longed, like
wolves for a fat sheep.&nbsp; And Nannincini, being sharp to a
keen edge, and knowing how to lend water and borrow wine, had
promised this estate in secret to everybody, and got from them
many a gratification, and supped and dined with them for years,
yet after this died without leaving a will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then six of his relations assembled and resolved to
secure the property, though they invoked the devil.&nbsp; And to
aid them they took a certain scamp named Giano di Selva, who
somewhat resembled the departed Nannincino, and he, calling in a
witch of his acquaintance, was made by sorcery to look as much
like the defunct as two beads of the same rosary.&nbsp; So
Nannincino was removed and Giano put in his place, where he lay
still for an hour, and then began to show signs of life.&nbsp;
And after a time he called for a notary and began to make his
will.&nbsp; First he left a house to one, and his sword to
another, and so on, till it came to the Mula a Quinto.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And who shall have the Mula a Quinto, dear good
uncle?&rsquo; asked a nephew.</p>
<p><!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;That,&rsquo; replied the dying man,
&lsquo;I leave to my good friend, the only true friend I ever
had, the noblest of men&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But what is his <i>name</i>?&rsquo; asked the
nephew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Giano di Selva,&rsquo; gasped the dying
man.&nbsp; And it was written down by the notary, and the will
was signed, and the signer died immediately after.&nbsp; All
their shaking could not revive him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tale ends with these words: <i>E cos&igrave;
ingannati gli ingannatori</i>, <i>rimase Giano herede del
podere</i>&mdash;And thus the biters being bit, d&rsquo;ye see,
Giano took a handsome property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And does his ghost still promenade the
palace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To oblige you, Signore, for this once&mdash;<i>place a
lei il comandare</i>&mdash;it does.&nbsp; The ghost
walks&mdash;always when the rent fails to come in, and there is
no money in the treasury&mdash;<i>cammina</i>, <i>cammina per un
fil di spada</i>&mdash;walks as straight as an acrobat on a
rope.&nbsp; But I cannot give you a walking ghost of a rascal to
every house, Signore.&nbsp; If all the knaves who made fortunes
by trickery were to take to haunting our houses in Florence, they
would have to lie ten in a bed, or live one hundred in a room,
and ghosts, as you know, love to be alone.&nbsp; <i>Mille
grazie</i>, Signore Carlo!&nbsp; This will keep <i>our</i> ghost
from walking for a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of which remark here made that &lsquo;<i>the ghost doth
walk</i>,&rsquo;&rdquo; comments the sage Flaxius, &ldquo;when
money is forbidden unto man (which is so commonly heard in
theatrical circles when the weekly salary is not paid), I have no
doubt that it comes from the many ancient legends which assign a
jealous guardian sprite to every hoard.&nbsp; And thus in
Spenser&rsquo;s wondrous &lsquo;Faerie Queene&rsquo; the
marvellous stores in Mammon&rsquo;s treasury, &lsquo;embost with
massy gold of glorious guifte,&rsquo; were watched by</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;An ugly feend more fowle than
dismall day;<br />
The which with monstrous stalk behind him stept,<br />
And ever as he went dew watch upon him kept.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The which quotation is in its turn otherwise curious
since it gave, I doubt not, the original suggestion to Coleridge
of the verse wherein mention is made in simile of one who walks
in tear and dread, and dares not turn his head&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;For well he knows a griesly fiend<br
/>
Doth close behind him tread.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;More or less accurately, my masters, more or
less.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis sixty years
since&rsquo;&mdash;I read the original.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The reader should never at once infer that a legend is recent
because it is attached to a new place.&nbsp; Spirits and
traditions are like the goblin of Norse tale, who moved with the
family.&nbsp; The family changed its home to get rid of him, but
on the way the elf popped his head out and remarked, &ldquo;<i>Wi
fl&uuml;tten</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;We&rsquo;re flitting&rdquo; or
moving).&nbsp; The ghost of Benjamin Franklin long haunted the
library which he had founded in Philadelphia, and when the
library or books were transferred to a new building, the ghost
went with them and his statue.&nbsp; And in like manner the
legend of the religious person, male or female, who is also a
<i>fish</i> has travelled over many lands, till it came to the
<i>vasca</i> or basin of the Porto San Gallo.&nbsp; Thus Leonard
Vair, in his charming <i>Trois Livres des Charmes</i>,
<i>Sorcelages ou Enchantemens</i>, Paris, 1583, tells us that
&ldquo;there is a cloister in Burgundy, by which there is a pond,
and in this pond are as many fish as there be monks in the
cloister.&nbsp; And when one of the fish swims on the surface of
the water and beats with its tail, then one of the monks is ever
ill.&rdquo;&nbsp; But there is a mass of early Christian or
un-Christian folklore which identifies &ldquo;Catholic
clergy-women&rdquo; with fish, even as Quakers are identified in
Philadelphia with shad.&nbsp; In Germany all maids just in <!--
page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>their teens are called <i>Backfisch</i>, that is,
pan-fish or <i>fritures</i>, from their youth and liveliness, or
delicacy.&nbsp; We may read in Friedrich that the fish is a
common Christian symbol of immortality, which fully accounts for
all legends of certain of them living for ever.&nbsp; The story
which I have to tell is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Lo Spirito
della Vasca della Porta San Gallo</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this fountain-basin is found a pretty little fish,
which is always there, and which no one can catch, because it
always escapes with great <i>lestezza</i> or agility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is the queen of all the other fish, or else
the Spirit of the Fountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This spirit, while on earth, was a beautiful girl who
loved an official, and he fell ill and was in the military
hospital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The parents of the maid opposed her marriage with this
official, though he was so much in love with her that it and
anxiety had made him ill.&nbsp; Then the maid became a nun so
that she might be near him in illness, and nurse him in his last
moments, which indeed came to pass, for he died, nor did she long
survive him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then her mother, who had magic power (<i>essendo stata
una fata</i> <a name="citation177"></a><a href="#footnote177"
class="citation">[177]</a>), regretted having opposed her
daughter&rsquo;s love and that of the young man, since it had
caused the death of both.&nbsp; And to amend this she so
enchanted them that by night both became <i>folletti</i> or
spirits haunting the hospital, while by day the maid becomes a
little fish living in the fountain.&nbsp; But when seen by night
she appears as a pretty little nun (<i>una bella monachina</i>),
and goes to the hospital to nurse the invalids, for which she
has, indeed, a passion.&nbsp; And if any one of them observes
her, he feels better, but in that instant she vanishes, and is in
the arms of her lover.&nbsp; But sometimes it happens that he
becomes jealous of a patient, and then he vexes the poor man in
every way, twitching off his covering, and playing him all kinds
of spiteful tricks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It is otherwise narrated, in a more consistent, and certainly
more traditionally truthful manner, that both <!-- page 178--><a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>the lovers
are fish by day and <i>folletti</i> by night.&nbsp; This brings
the legend to close resemblance with the undying fish of Bowscale
Tarn, recorded in Wordsworth&rsquo;s beautiful song at the feast
of Brougham Castle in the &ldquo;Poems of the
Imagination.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis worth noting,&rdquo; pens the observant
Flaxius on this, &ldquo;that in days of yore fish, feminines, and
fascination were considered so inseparable that Dr. Johannes
Christian Fromann wrote a chapter on this mystical trinity,
observing that music was, as an attractor, connected with them,
as shown by dolphins, syrens, Arions, and things of that
sort.&nbsp; And he quoted&mdash;yea, in the holy Latin
tongue&mdash;many instances of fishers who entice their finny
prey by playing flutes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Which thing I doubted till I saw
that Doubt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pursued, its refutation oft begets,<br />
When in America I once found out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That shad were caught by means of castin&rsquo;
nets!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

class="pagenum">p. 179</span>STORY OF THE PODEST&Agrave; WHO WAS
LONG ON HIS JOURNEY<br />
<span class="smcap">a legend of the duomo</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Were I ten times as tedious, I would find
it in my heart to bestow it all on
you.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Dogberry</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This little tale is told by the Florentine Poggio, who was
born in 1380 and died in 1459, yet lived&mdash;in his well-known
<i>Facezie</i>.&nbsp; But as it ever was and is a folk-story,
independently of the great jester, I think it worthy of a place
in this collection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was once a podest&agrave; sent from Rome to
govern Florence, and truly he was of that kind who to a
farthing&rsquo;s worth of sense have ten ducats&rsquo; value in
self-conceit; for if vanity could have kept a man warm, he never
would have had need to buy blankets.&nbsp; And this was most
shown in his belief that he was a great orator, though he was so
intolerably stupid and slow that his speeches were like the
post-rider of Giordano, who in good weather sometimes got as far
as five miles a day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now he was to be inducted into office in the Cathedral,
in the presence of the <i>priori</i>, or notables of the city of
Florence, and so begun a discourse in which he first of all
described how great a man he had been as senator in Rome, and
what he had done, and what everybody else connected with him had
done, and all the details of his departure from the Eternal City;
and then depicted a banquet given to him at Sutro, and so went
on, telling everything about everybody, till, after several hours
of terribly tiresome discourse, he had got no farther than
Siena.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now by this time, as Poggio words it, &lsquo;This
excessive length of wearisome narration had so exhausted his
auditors that they began to fear that the entire day would be
spent on <!-- page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>the road,&rsquo; and at last, as the
shades of night began to fall, one who was present rose and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Monsignore, I beg you to remember that it is
growing late, and you must really get on a little faster in your
journey, for if you are not in Florence to-day, the gates will be
shut, and unless you get here in time you will not be allowed to
enter, and thus you will miss being ordained, and cannot enter on
your office.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which having heard, the man of many words promptly
concluded his speech by saying that he was really in
Florence.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Southey, in &ldquo;The Doctor,&rdquo; has narrated a number of
instances of tedious discourse, but none, I think, quite equal to
this.</p>
<p>There is a shadow under every lamp, a devil&rsquo;s chapel
close by every church, and even of the venerable and holy Duomo
of Florence there are such tales as the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">La Messa
de&rsquo; Villani</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there is any faith to be put in old stories and
ancient books, even the ladies and gentleman, to say nothing of
priests, used such language in their ordinary conversation, in
good old Medici times, as would not be heard among any but the
lowest people now-a-days.&nbsp; Well, as the saying is:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ne di tempo, n&egrave; di
Signoria,<br />
Non ti dar malinconia.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Fret not thyself for time long past away,<br />
For weather, nor for what the great may say.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it happened one morning in Florence that a
<i>gentil donna</i>, who, I take it, was more <i>donna</i> than
truly <i>gentil</i>, whatever her rank may have been, meeting at
the door of the Duomo a very ordinary and rough figure of her
acquaintance, who had only made himself look more vulgar by new
and gaudy clothes, asked him as he came out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is the Cads&rsquo; Mass <a
name="citation180"></a><a href="#footnote180"
class="citation">[180]</a> over already?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To which he, in nowise put out, promptly replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, Madonna, and that of the Demireps is just
going to <!-- page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>begin; <a name="citation181"></a><a
href="#footnote181" class="citation">[181]</a> only hurry, and
you&rsquo;ll be there in time with the rest of
&rsquo;em!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that lifted him to celebrity, for in those famous
days a small joke often made a great reputation.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp;
Signore&mdash;a great many of us have been born into this world
four hundred years too late&mdash;more&rsquo;s the pity!&nbsp;
However, the lady learned the truth of the old proverb,
&lsquo;<i>Guardati del villan</i>, <i>quando h&agrave; la camicia
bianca</i>&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Look out for a vulgar fellow when
he has a clean shirt on,&rsquo; for then he thinks himself fine
enough to say anything saucy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there is yet another story of the same sort,
Signore; indeed, I think that while the world lasts there will
always be a few of them left for steady customers, under the
counter, like smuggled goods in Venice; and it is this: It befell
once that a Florentine fell in love with a lady, who was like her
mother, <i>come il ramo al tronco
s&rsquo;assomiglia</i>&mdash;&lsquo;as the bough to the tree, or
very much worse than she ought to be;&rsquo; for the dear mamma
was like the Porta San Niccol&ograve;, only not so well
famed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, the gentleman wedded her, never heeding the
proverb:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let every wooer be afraid<br />
To wed a maiden not a maid;<br />
For sooner or later, as &rsquo;tis said,<br />
She&rsquo;ll turn again unto her trade.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;However, in this case the proverb got the lie, for the
lady after she was married behaved with great propriety, and yet
was often reminded that she had better have repented before she
sinned than after; for many would not speak to her, for all her
wealth, till she was well convinced that <i>Che profitta
ravedersi dopo il fatto</i>?</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When the deed has once been done,<br
/>
What is the use of repenting, my son?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;So it befell one morning that the poor soul was praying
in the Cathedral or Duomo, as many another poor sinner had done
before her (doubtless on the same spot), when a noble lady, who
had never been found out in any naughtiness (some people are
certainly very lucky in this world, Signore Carlo!), came by, and
seeing the penitent, drew in her robe, turned up her nose, and
retreated as if the other had the plague.&nbsp; To which the
Magdalen replied, in a sad but firm voice, &lsquo;Madonna, <!--
page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>you need not be afraid to touch me, for I assure you
that the malady (of which I have, I trust, been thoroughly cured)
attacks none save those who wish to have it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>When standing in the Cathedral, the visitor may remember that
here Santo Crescenzio, who died in 424, once wrought a miracle,
thus recorded in his &ldquo;Life&rdquo; of the fourteenth
century:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A poor man had come into the Cathedral and
saw no light (<i>i.e.</i>, was blind), and going to where Saint
Crescentius was, implored him with great piety that he would
cause the light to return unto him.&nbsp; And being moved to
pity, he made the sign of the cross in the eyes of the blind man,
and incontinently the light was restored unto him.&nbsp; Saint
Crescentius did not wish this to be made known, and pretended to
know nothing about it, but he could not conceal such
miracles.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of which the immortal Flaxius remarks, that &ldquo;it is
singular that so many saints who wished to keep their miracles
unknown had not the forethought to make silence a condition of
cure.&nbsp; Also, that of all the wonder-working once effected by
the holy men of the Church, the only gift now remaining to them
is the miraculous power of changing sons and daughters into
nephews and nieces; the which, as I am assured, is still as
flourishing as ever, and permitted as a proof of
transubstantiation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus it is that simple heretics
deride holy men.&nbsp; And Flaxius is, I bid ye note, a sinner,
in whose antique, unsanctified derision I most assuredly do take
no part, &ldquo;it being in bad form in this our age to believe
or disbelieve in anything,&rdquo; and therefore in bad style to
laugh at aught.</p>
<p>It may be worth recalling, when looking out on the Cathedral
Square, that it was here that San Zenobio performed another great
miracle, recorded in all his lives, but most briefly in the
poetical one:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Then did he raise an orphan from the
dead,<br />
The only son of a poor widow, he,<br />
A cart with oxen passing o&rsquo;er his head,<br />
Died in the Duomo Square in misery;<br />
<!-- page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>But though all crushed, the Saint restored his life,<br
/>
And, well and gay and bright as stars do shine,<br />
He went to his mother, and the pious wife<br />
Gave thanks to God for mercy all divine.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which being witnessed, says the <i>Vita San Zenobii</i>, all
who were present began to sing, &ldquo;<i>Gloria tibi Domine qui
mirabilia per servos tuos in nobis operari dignatus es</i>,
<i>gloria sit tibi-i et laus in
s&aelig;cu-la&mdash;sec-u-lo-o-o-rum</i>, <i>A-men</i>.</p>
<p>Which, if they sung it as I heard it sung yesterday in the
Cathedral of Siena, must have had an extremely soporific effect,
lulling all others to sleep, and causing them to see beatific
visions beyond all belief.&nbsp; I had in my boyhood a teacher
named Professor Sears C. Walker, who was wont to tell how he had
once heard in a rural New England village a church congregation
sing:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Before thy throne the angels
bow-wow-wow-ow!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But to hear the <i>bow-wow</i> in perfection, one must go to
Rome.&nbsp; A pack in full cry or a chorus of owls is nothing to
it.&nbsp; But let us pass on to a fresh story.</p>

<p>A great showman, as I have heard, once declared that in
establishing a menagerie, one should have the indispensable lion,
an <i>obligato</i> elephant, a requisite tiger, an essential
camel, and imperative monkeys.&nbsp; One of the
&ldquo;indispensable lions&rdquo; of Florence is the Boboli
Gardens, joining the Pitti Palace, which, from their careful
preservation in their original condition, give an admirable idea
of what gardens were like in an age when far more was thought of
them than now as places of habitual resort and enjoyment, and
when they entered into all literature and life.&nbsp; Abraham
&agrave; Santa Clara once wrote a discourse against gardens, as
making life too happy or simple, basing his idea on the fact that
sin originated in the Garden of Eden.</p>
<p>The Boboli Gardens were planned by Il Tribolo for Cosimo di
Medici.&nbsp; The ground which they occupy is greatly varied,
rising high in some places, from which very beautiful views of
Florence, with its &ldquo;walls and churches, palaces and
towers,&rdquo; may be seen.&nbsp; Of their <!-- page 185--><a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>many
attractions the guide-book remarks poetically in very nearly the
following words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Its long-embowered walks, like lengthened
arbours,<br />
Are well adapted to the summer&rsquo;s sun;<br />
While statues, terraces, and vases add<br />
Still more unto its splendour.&nbsp; All around<br />
We see attractive statues, and of these<br />
A number really are restored antiques,<br />
And many by good artists; best of all<br />
Are four by mighty Michel Angelo,<br />
Made for the second Julius, and meant<br />
To decorate his tomb.&nbsp; You see them at<br />
The angles of the grotto opposite<br />
The entrance to the gardens.&nbsp; Of this grot<br />
The famous Redi sang in verse grotesque:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye satyrs, in a trice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Leave your low jests and verses rough and hobbly,<br
/>
And bring me a good fragment of the ice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Kept in the grotto of the Garden Boboli.<br />

Into the finest powder, freezing cold.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are also, among the things worth seeing, the Venus by
Giovanni of Boulogne (called di Bologna); the Apollo and Ceres by
Baccio Bandinelli; the group of Paris carrying off Helen by V.
de&rsquo; Rossi, and the old Roman fountain-bath and
obelisk.&nbsp; The trees and flowers, shrubbery and
<i>boschetti</i>, are charming; and if the reader often visits
them, long sitting in the sylvan shade on sunny days, he will not
fail to feel that strange enchantment which seems to haunt
certain places, and people them with dreams, if not with
elves.</p>
<p>The fascination of these dark arbours old, and of the antique
gardens, has been recognised by many authors, and there are, I
suppose, few visitors to Florence who have not felt it and
recalled it years after in distant lands as one recalls a
dream.&nbsp; Therefore, I read with interest <!-- page 186--><a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>or sympathy
the following, which, though amounting to nothing as a legend, is
still valuable as setting forth the fascination of the place, and
how it dates even from him who gave the Boboli Gardens their
name:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Il Giardino
Boboli</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Boboli Garden is the most beautiful in Europe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boboli was the name of the farmer who cultivated the
land before it was bought by Cosimo de&rsquo; Medici and his wife
Eleanora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After he had sold the property he remained buried in
grief, because he had an attachment for it such as some form for
a dog or a cat.&nbsp; And so great was his love for it that it
never left his mind, nor could he ever say amen to it; for on
whatever subject he might discourse, it always came in like one
who will not be kept out, and his refrain was, &lsquo;Well,
you&rsquo;ll see that my place will become <i>il nido degli
amori</i> (the nest of loves), and I myself after my death will
never be absent from it.&rsquo;&nbsp; His friends tried to
dissuade him from thinking so much of it, saying that he would
end by being lunatic, but he persevered in it till he died.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it really came to pass as he said; for soon after
his death, and ever since, many have on moonlight nights seen his
spirit occupied in working in the gardens.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The story is a pretty one, and it is strangely paralleled by
one narrated in my own Memoirs of the old Penington mansion in
Philadelphia, the gardens of which were haunted by a gentle
ghost, a lady who had lived there in her life, and who was, after
her death, often seen watering the flowers in them by
moonlight.&nbsp; And thus do&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;printless
footsteps fall<br />
By the spots they loved before.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second legend which I recovered, relating to the Boboli
Gardens, is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 187--><a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span><span
class="smcap">Le Due Statue e la Ninfa</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are in the Boboli Gardens two statues of two
imprisoned kings, and it is said that every night a beautiful
fairy of the grotto clad in white rises from the water, emerging
perfectly dry, and converses with the captive kings for one hour,
going alternately from one to the other, as if bearing mutual
messages, and then returns to the grotto, gliding over the ground
without touching the grass with her feet, and after this vanishes
in the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This tale is, as I conceive,&rdquo; writes the
observant Flaxius, &ldquo;an allegory, or, as Petrus Berchorius
would have called it, a <i>moralisation</i>, the marrow whereof
is as follows: The two captive kings are Labour and Capital, who
have, indeed, been long enchained, evil tongues telling each that
the other was his deadly foe, while the fairy is Wise Reform, who
passes her time in consoling and reconciling them.&nbsp; And it
shall come to pass that when the go-betweens or brokering
mischief-makers are silenced, then the kings will be free and
allied.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Then indeed, as you may see,<br />
All the world will happy be!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Vivat Sequenz</i>!&nbsp; Now for the next story.</p>
<h2><!-- page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>HOW LA VIA DELLA MOSCA GOT ITS
NAME</h2>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Puer&mdash;abige Muscas!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right" class="poetry">&mdash;<i>Cicero de
Orat.</i>, 60.</p>
<p>The following story contains no new or original elements, as
it is only an ordinary tale of transformation by witchcraft, but
as it accounts for the origin of the name of a street in Florence
I give it place:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">La Via della
Mosca</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the way that the Via della Mosca, or the Street
of the Fly, got its name.&nbsp; There once dwelt in it, in a very
old house, a family which, while of rank, were not very wealthy,
and therefore lived in a retired manner.&nbsp; There were father,
mother, and one daughter, who was wonderfully
beautiful&mdash;<i>un vero occhio di sole</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as the sun hath its shadow, so there was a living
darkness in this family in a <i>donna di servizio</i>, a servant
woman who had been many years with them, who had a daughter of
her own, who was also a beauty of a kind, but as dark as the
other was fair; the two were like day and night, and as they
differed in face, so were they unlike in soul.&nbsp; For the
young signora had not a fault in her; she would not have caused
any one pain even to have her own way or please her vanity, and
they say the devil will drop dead whenever he shall meet with
such a woman as <i>that</i>.&nbsp; However, he never met with
this young lady, I suppose, because he is living yet.&nbsp; And
the young lady was so gentle of heart that she never said an ill
word of any one, while the maid and her mother never opened their
mouths save for gossip and slander.&nbsp; And she was so occupied
with constant charity, and caring for poor children, and finding
work for poor people, that she never thought about her own beauty
at all, and when people told her that <i>chi nasce bella</i>,
<!-- page 189--><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span><i>nasce maritata</i> (Whoever is born pretty is born
to be married), she would reply, &lsquo;Pretty or ugly, there are
things more important in life than weddings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so far did she carry this, that she gave no heed at
all to a very gallant and handsome yet good-hearted honourable
wealthy young gentleman who lived in a palazzo opposite, and who,
from watching and admiring her, had ended by falling desperately
in love.&nbsp; So he made a proposal of marriage to her through
her parents, but she replied (having had her mind, in truth, on
other things) that she was too much taken up with other duties to
properly care for a husband, and that her dowry was not
sufficient to correspond to his wealth, however generous he might
be in dispensing with one.&nbsp; And as she was as firm and
determined as she was gentle and good, she resolutely kept him at
arm&rsquo;s length.&nbsp; But firmness is nothing against fate,
and he &lsquo;who runs away with nimble feet, in the war of love
at last will beat.&rsquo; <a name="citation189"></a><a
href="#footnote189" class="citation">[189]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, if she was indifferent to the young signore, the
dark maid-servant was not, for she had fallen as much in love
with him as an evil, selfish nature would permit her, and she
planned and plotted with her mother by night and by day to bring
about what she desired.&nbsp; Now, the old woman, unknown to all,
was a witch, as all wicked women really are&mdash;they rot away
with vanity and self-will and evil feelings till their hearts are
like tinder or gunpowder, and then some day comes a spark of the
devil&rsquo;s fire, and they flash out into witches of some
kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young signore had a great love for boating on the
Arno, which was a deeper river in those days; he would often pass
half the night in his boat.&nbsp; Now, the mother and daughter so
contrived it that the young signorina should return very late on
a certain night from visiting the poor, accompanied by the old
woman.&nbsp; And when just in the middle of the Ponte Vecchio the
mother gave a whistle, and lo! there came a sudden and terrible
blast of wind, which lifted up the young lady and whirled her
over the bridge into the rushing river underneath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, as fate would have it, the young man was in his
boat just below, and fortune fell down to him, as it were, from
heaven; for seeing a form float or flit past him in the water and
the darkness, he caught at it and drew it into the boat, <!--
page 190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>and truly Pilate&rsquo;s wife was not so astonished
when the roast capon rose up in the dish and crowed as was this
boatman at finding what he had fished up out of the stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a saying of a very unlucky contrary sort of
man that <i>casco in Arno ed arse</i> (He fell in the Arno and
burnt himself).&nbsp; But in this case, by luck, the falling of
the young lady into the river caused her heart to burn with love,
for so bravely and courteously and kindly did the young signore
behave, conveying her promptly home without a sign of love-making
or hint of the past, that she began to reconsider her refusal,
and the end thereof was a betrothal, by which the mother and
daughter were maddened to think that they had only hastened and
aided what they had tried to prevent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, it is true that bad people put ten times as much
strong will and hard work into their evil acts as good folk do
into better deeds, because the latter think their cause will help
itself along, while the sinners know perfectly well that they
must help themselves or lose.&nbsp; So the witch only persevered
the more, and at last she hit on this plan.&nbsp; With much
devilish ado she enchanted a comb of thorns, so that whoever was
combed with it would turn into a fly, and must remain one till
the witch bade the victim assume his or her usual form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then on the bridal morn the old woman offered to comb
out the long golden locks of the young lady, and she did so, no
other person being present, so she began her incantation:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Earthly beauty fade away,<br />
Maiden&rsquo;s form no longer stay,<br />
For a fly thou shalt become,<br />
And as a busy insect hum,<br />
<i>Hum&mdash;hum&mdash;brum&mdash;brum</i>!<br />
<i>Buzz-uz-uz</i> about the room!</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ope thine eyes and spread thy wings,<br />
Pass away to insect things.<br />
Now the world will hate thee more<br />
Than it ever loved before<br />
When it hears thy ceaseless hum,<br />
<i>Buzz-uz-uz</i> about the room!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And hearing this, the bride sank into a deep sleep,
during which she changed into a fly, and so soared up to the
ceiling and about the room, buzzing indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, with all her cleverness, the witch had missed a
stitch in her sorcery, for she had not combed hard enough to
<i>draw blood</i>, being afraid to wake the maid; hence it came
to pass <!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>that instead of a small common fly
she became a very large and exquisitely beautiful one, with a
head like gold, a silver body, and beautiful blue and silver
wings like her bridal dress.&nbsp; And she was not confined to
buzzing, for she had the power to sing one verse.&nbsp; However,
when the change took place, the old woman rushed from the room
screaming like mad, declaring that her young mistress was a witch
who had turned into a fly as soon as she had touched her with a
consecrated comb which had been dipped in holy water, and to this
she added many lies, as that a witch to avoid the holy sacrament
of marriage always changed her form, and that she had always
suspected the signorina of being a witch ever since she had seen
her fly in the wind over the Arno to the young signore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when they went to look at the fly, and found it so
large and beautiful, they were amazed, nor were they less
astonished when they heard it begin to buzz with a most
entrancing strangely sweet sound, and then sing:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Be ye not amazed that I<br />
Am enchanted as a fly,<br />
Evil witchcraft was around me,<br />
Evil witches&rsquo; spells have bound me:<br />
Now I am a fly I know,<br />
But woe to her who made me so!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And when the young signore stretched out his hand, the
fly came buzzing with joy and lighted like a bird on his finger,
and this she did with great joy whenever any of the poor whom she
had befriended came to see her, and so she behaved to all whom
she had loved.&nbsp; And when it was observed that the fly had no
fear of holy things, but seemed to love them, all believed in her
song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Till one day the young signore, calling all the family
and friends together, said: &lsquo;This is certainly true, that
she who was to have been my wife is here, turned into a
fly.&nbsp; And as for her being a witch, ye can all see that she
fears neither holy water nor a crucifix.&nbsp; But I believe that
these women here, her nurse and daughter, have filled our ears
with lies, and that the nurse herself is the sorceress who hath
done the evil deed.&nbsp; Now, I propose that we take all three,
the fly, the mother, and daughter, and hang the room with
verbena, which I have provided, and sprinkle the three with much
holy water, all of us making the <i>castagna</i> and
<i>jettatura</i>, and see what will come of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the two witches began to scream and protest in a
<!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>rage, but as soon as they opened their mouths, holy
water was dashed into their faces, whereat they howled more
horribly than ever, and at last promised, if their lives should
be spared in any manner, to tell the whole truth, and to
disenchant the bride.&nbsp; Which they forthwith did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then those present seized the witches, and said:
&lsquo;Your lives shall indeed be spared, but it is only just
that ere ye go ye shall be as nicely combed, according to the
proverb which says, &ldquo;Comb me and I&rsquo;ll comb
thee!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Said and done, but the combing this time drew blood,
and the mother and daughter, shrinking smaller and smaller, flew
away at last as two vile carrion-flies through the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as the story spread about Florence, every one came
to see the house where this had happened, and so it was that the
street got the name of the <i>Via della Mosca</i> or Fly
Lane.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There is a curious point in this story well worth
noting.&nbsp; In it the sorceress lulls the maiden to sleep
before transforming her, that is, causes her death before
reviving her with a comb of thorns.&nbsp; Now, the thorn is a
deep symbol of death&mdash;naturally enough from its dagger-like
form&mdash;all over the world wherever it grows.&nbsp; As
Schwenck writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the Germanic mythology the thorn is an
emblem of death, as is the nearly allied long and deep
slumber&mdash;the idea being that death kills with a sharp
instrument which is called in the Edda the sleep-thorn, which
belongs to Odin the god of death.&nbsp; It also occurs as a
person in the Nibelungen Lied as H&ouml;gni, Hagen, &lsquo;the
thorn who kills Siegfried.&rsquo;&nbsp; The tale of
Dornr&ouml;schen (the sleeping beauty), owes its origin to the
sleep-thorn, which is, however, derived from the death-thorn,
death being an eternal sleep.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is all true, and sleep is like death.&nbsp; But the
soothing influence of a comb produces sleep quite apart from any
association with death.</p>
<p>Apropos of flies, there is a saying, which is, like all new or
eccentric sayings, or old and odd ones revived, called
&ldquo;American.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is, &ldquo;There are no flies on
him,&rdquo; or more vulgarly, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got no flies
on <i>me</i>,&rdquo; and signifies <!-- page 193--><a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>that the
person thus exempt is so brisk and active, and &ldquo;flies
round&rdquo; at such a rate, that no insect has an opportunity to
alight on him.&nbsp; The same saying occurs in the <i>Proverbi
Italiani</i> of Orlando Pescetti, Venice, 1618, <i>Non si lascia
posar le mosche addosso</i> (He lets no flies light on him).</p>
<p>When I was a small boy in America, the general teaching to us
was that it was cruel to kill flies, and I have heard it
illustrated with a tale of an utterly depraved little girl of
three years, who, addressing a poor fly which was buzzing in the
window-pane, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you love your Dod, &rsquo;ittle fy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to <i>see</i> your Dod, &rsquo;ittle
fy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&rdquo; (with a vicious jab of the finger),
&ldquo;you <span class="smcap">shall</span>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with the last word the soul of the fly had departed to
settle its accounts in another world.&nbsp; Writing here in
Siena, the most fly-accursed or Beelzebubbed town in Italy, on
July 25th, being detained by illness, I love that little angel of
a girl, and think with utter loathing and contempt of dear old
Uncle Toby and his &ldquo;Go&mdash;go, poor fly!&rdquo;&nbsp;
True, I agree with him to his second &ldquo;go,&rdquo; but there
our sentiments diverge&mdash;the reader may complete the sentence
for himself&mdash;out of Ernulphus!</p>
<p>On which the wise Flaxius comments as follows on the proof
with his red pencil:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It hath been observed by the learned that
the speed of a fly, were he to make even a slight effort to go
directly onwards, would be from seventy to eighty miles an hour,
during which transit he would find far more attractive food,
pleasanter places wherein to buzz about, and more beautiful views
than he meets with in this humble room of mine, wherein I, from
hour to hour, do with a towel rise and slay his kind.&nbsp; Oh,
reader! how many men there are who, to soaring far and wide in
life amid honeyed flowers and pleasant places, prefer to buzz
about in short flights in little rooms where they can tease some
one, and defile all they touch as domestic gossips do&mdash;but,
&rsquo;tis enough!&nbsp; <i>Mutato nomine de te fabula
narratur</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<span class="smcap">a legend of bellosguardo</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;From Tuscan Bellosguardo<br />
Where Galileo stood at nights to take<br />
The vision of the stars, we have found it hard,<br />
Gazing upon the earth and heavens, to make<br />
A choice of beauty.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Elizabeth
Barrett Browning</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bellosguardo is an eminence on a height, crowned with an
ancient, castle-like monastery, from which there is a magnificent
view of Florence.&nbsp; It is a haunted legendary spot;
<i>fate</i> and witches sweep round its walls by night, while the
cry of the <i>civetta</i> makes music for their a&euml;rial
dance, and in the depths of the hill lie buried mystic treasures,
or the relics of mysterious beings of the olden time, and the
gnome of the rocks there has his dwelling in subterranean
caves.&nbsp; Of this place I have the following legend from
Maddalena:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Il Vaso
Romano</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was, long ago, in the time of Duke Lorenzo di
Medici, a young gardener, who was handsome, clever, and learned
beyond the other men of his kind, a man given somewhat to
witchcraft and mysteries of ancient days, for he had learned
Latin of the monks and read books of history.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And one day when he was working with his companions in
the garden of Bellosguardo, taking out stones, they came to an
old Roman vase, which the rest would fain have broken to pieces
as a heathenish and foul thing, because there was carved on it
the figure of a beautiful Pagan goddess, and it was full of the
ashes of some dead person.&nbsp; But the young man suddenly felt
a great passion, a desire to possess it, and <!-- page 195--><a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>it seemed
as if something said to him, &lsquo;<i>Con questo vaso ci&egrave;
un mistero</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mine own in truth that vase shall
ever be,<br />
For there is in it some strange mystery.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;So he begged for it, and it was readily granted to
him.&nbsp; And looking at it, he perceived that it was carved of
fine marble, and that the figure on it was that of a beautiful
nymph, or a Bellaria flying in the air, and there came from the
ashes which it held a sweet odour of some perfume which was
unknown to him.&nbsp; Now as he had, <i>sentito ragionare tanto
di fate</i>, heard much talk of supernatural beings, so he
reflected: &lsquo;Some <i>fata</i> must have dwelt here in days
of old, and she was here buried, and this vase is now as a body
from which the spirit freely passes, therefore I will show it
respect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so he hung round the neck of the vase a wreath of
the most beautiful and fragrant roses, and draped a veil over it
to shield it from dust, and set it up under cover in his own
garden, and sang to it as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Vaso! o mio bel vaso!<br />
Di rose ti ho contornato.<br />
La rosa e un bel fior,<br />
Pi&ugrave; bello e il suo odor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Vase, oh lovely vase of mine!<br />
With roses I thy neck entwine;<br />
The rose is beautiful in bloom,<br />
More beautiful its sweet perfume,<br />
The finest rose above I place,<br />
To give the whole a crowning grace,<br />
As thou dost crown my dwelling-place<br />
Another rose I hide within,<br />
As thou so long hast hidden been,<br />
Since Roman life in thee I see,<br />
Rosa Romana thou shalt be!<br />
And ever thus be called by me!<br />
And as the rose in early spring<br />
Rises to re-awakening,<br />
Be it in garden, fair, or plain,<br />
From death to blooming life again,<br />
So rise, oh fairy of the flowers,<br />
And seek again these shady bowers!<br />
Come every morning to command<br />
My flowers, and with thy tiny hand<br />
Curve the green leaf and bend the bough,<br />
And teach the blossoms how to blow;<br />
But while you give them living care,<br />
Do not neglect the gardener;<br />
<!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>And as he saved your lovely urn,<br />
I pray protect him too in turn,<br />
Even as I this veil have twined,<br />
To guard thee from the sun and wind:<br />
Oh, Fairy of the Vase&mdash;to you,<br />
As Queen of all the Fairies too,<br />
And Goddess of the fairest flowers<br />
In earthly fields or elfin bowers,<br />
To thee with earnest heart I pray,<br />
Grant me such favour as you may.&rsquo; <a
name="citation196"></a><a href="#footnote196"
class="citation">[196]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Then he saw slowly rising from the vase, little by
little, a beautiful woman, who sang:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tell me what is thy desire,<br />
Oh youth, and what dost thou require?<br />
From realms afar I come to thee,<br />
For thou indeed hast summoned me,<br />
With such sweet love and gentleness,<br />
That I in turn thy life would bless,<br />
And aye thy fond protectress be.<br />
What would&rsquo;st thou, youth, I ask, of me?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And the young man replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Fair lady, at a glance I knew,<br />
Thy urn and felt thy spirit too,<br />
And straight the yearning through me sped,<br />
To raise thee from the living dead;<br />
I felt thy spell upon my brow,<br />
And loved thee as I love thee now.<br />
Even as I loved unknown before,<br />
And so shall love thee evermore,<br />
And happiness enough &rsquo;twould be<br />
If thou would&rsquo;st ever live with me!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Then the spirit replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A debt indeed to thee I owe,<br />
And full reward will I bestow;<br />
The roses which thou&rsquo;st given me<br />
With laurel well repaid shall be;<br />
Without thy rose I had not risen<br />
Again from this my earthly prison,<br />
And as it raised me to the skies,<br />
So by the laurel thou shalt rise!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 197--><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>&ldquo;The youth answered:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Every evening at thy shrine<br />
Fresh roses, lady, I will twine;<br />
But tell me next what &rsquo;tis for fate<br />
That I must do, or what await?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The fairy sang:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A mighty mission, youth, indeed<br
/>
Hast thou to fill, and that with speed,<br />
Since it depends on thee to save<br />
All Florence from a yawning grave,<br />
From the worst form of blood and fire,<br />
And sword and conflagration dire.<br />
Thou dost the Duke Lorenzo know;<br />
Straight to that mighty leader go!<br />
The Chieftain of the Medici,<br />
And tell him what I tell to thee,<br />
That he is compassed all about<br />
With armed enemies without,<br />
Who soon will bold attack begin,<br />
Linked to conspiracy within;<br />
And bid him ere the two have crossed,<br />
To rise in strength or all is lost,<br />
Ring loud the storm-bell in alarms,<br />
Summon all Florence straight to arms:<br />
Lorenzo knows well what to do.<br />
Take thou thy sword and battle too!<br />
And in the fray I&rsquo;ll look to thee:<br />
Go forth, my friend, to victory.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Then the young man went to the Duke Lorenzo, and told
him, with words of fire which bore conviction, of the great peril
which threatened him.&nbsp; Then there was indeed alarming and
arming, and a terrible battle all night long, in which the young
man fought bravely, having been made captain of a company which
turned the fight.&nbsp; And the Grand Duke, impressed by his
genius and his valour, gave him an immense reward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he rose in life, and became a <i>gran signore</i>,
and one of the Council in Florence, and lord of Bellosguardo, and
never neglected to twine every day a fresh wreath of roses round
the Roman vase, and every evening he was visited by the
fairy.&nbsp; And so it went on well with him till he died, and
after that the spirit was seen no more.&nbsp; The witches say
that the vase is, however, somewhere still in Florence, and that
while it exists the city will prosper; but to call the fairy
again it must be crowned with roses, and he who does so must
pronounce with such faith as the gardener had, the same
incantation.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><!-- page 198--><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>What is remarkable in the original text of this tale is
the rudeness and crudeness of the language in which it is
written, which is indeed so great that its real spirit or meaning
might easily escape any one not familiar with such
composition.&nbsp; But I believe that I have rendered it very
faithfully.</p>
<p>There seems to be that, however, in Bellosguardo which
inspires every poet.&nbsp; Two of the most beautiful passages in
English literature, one by Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and
another by Hawthorne, describe the views seen from it.&nbsp; The
castle itself is deeply impressed on my memory, for during the
past nine months I have never once raised my eyes from the table
where I write without beholding it in full view before me across
the Arno, even as I behold it now.</p>
<p>I cannot help observing that the mysterious sentiment which
seized on the hero of this tale when he found his virgin relic,
was marvellously like that which inspired Keats when he addressed
his Ode to a Grecian Urn:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thou still unravished bride of
quietness!<br />
Thou foster-child of Silence and slow Time,<br />
Sylvan historian who canst thus express<br />
A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:<br />
What leaf-fringed legend haunts about thy shape?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That which I have here given is truly a leaf-fringed legend,
for it is bordered with the petals of roses and embalmed with
their perfume, and one which in the hands of a great master might
have been made into a really beautiful poem.&nbsp; It came near a
very gay rhymer at least in the Duke Lorenzo de&rsquo; Medici,
whose songs, which were a little more than free, and rather more
loose than easy, were the delight and disgrace of his time.&nbsp;
And yet I cannot help rejoicing to meet this magnificent patron
of art and letters at so late a day in a purely popular
tale.&nbsp; There are <i>men</i> of beauty who are also a joy for
ever, as well as things, and Lorenzo was one of them.</p>
<p><!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>It is worth noting that just as the fairy in this tale
reveals to Lorenzo that Florence is threatened by enemies, just
so it happened that unto Saint Zenobio, standing rapt in divine
contemplation in his cavern, it was announced that the same city
was about to be assailed by cruel barbarians, who, as Sigbert
relates in his Chronicle of 407 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>,
were the two hundred thousand Goths led by Radagasio into
Italy.&nbsp; But they were soon driven away by the Saint&rsquo;s
prayers and penitence.&nbsp; It would be curious if one legend
had here passed into another:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;So visions in a vision live again,<br />
And dreams in dreams are wondrously transfused;<br />
Gold turning into grey as clouds do change,<br />
And shifting hues as they assume new forms.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apropos of Saint Zenobio of Florence, I will here give
something which should have been included with the legend of the
Croce al Trebbio, but which I obtained too late for that
purpose.&nbsp; It would appear from the <i>Iscrizioni e Memorie
di Firenze</i>, by F. Bigazzi (1887), that the <i>pillar</i> of
the cross was really erected to commemorate a victory over
heretics, but that the cross itself was added by the Saints
Ambrosio and Zenobio, &ldquo;on account of a great
mystery&rdquo;&mdash;which mystery is, I believe, fully explained
by the legend which I have given.&nbsp; The inscription when
complete was as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">sanctus ambrosius cum sancto zenobio propter grande
misterium</span><br />
<span class="smcap">hunc crucem hic locaverunt. et in mcccxxxviii
noviter die</span><br />
<span class="smcap">10 augusti reconsecrata est p. d. m.
francisc. flor.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">episcopum una cum aliis episcopis
m.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A slightly different reading is given by Brocchi (<i>Vite
de&rsquo; Santi fiorentini</i>, 1742).</p>
<p><!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>&ldquo;Of which saint, be it observed,&rdquo; writes
Flaxius, &ldquo;that there is in England a very large and widely
extended family, or <i>stirps</i>, named Snobs, who may claim
that by affinity of name to Zenobio they are lineally or
collaterally his descendants, even as the Potts profess
connection with Pozzo del Borgo.&nbsp; But as it is said of this
family or <i>gens</i> that they are famed for laying claim to
every shadow of a shade of gentility, it may be that there is
truly no Zenobility about them.&nbsp; Truly there are a great
many more people in this world who are proud of their ancestors,
than there ever were ancestors who would have been proud of
them.&nbsp; The number of whom is as the sands of the sea, or as
Heine says, &lsquo;more correctly speaking, as the mud on the
shore.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The which, more eath it were for
mortall wight,<br />
To sell the sands or count the starres on hye;<br />
Or ought more hard, then thinke to reckon right . . .<br />
Which&mdash;for my Muse herselfe now tyred has,<br />
Unto another tale I&rsquo;ll overpas.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have elsewhere remarked that there is&mdash;chiefly about
the Duomo&mdash;a group of small streets bearing the dismal names
of Death, Hell, Purgatory, Limbo, Crucifixion, Our Lady of
Coughing (<i>delle Tosse</i>), The (last) Rest of Old Age,
Gallows Lane (<i>Via della Forca</i>), The Tombs, The Way of the

class="citation">[201]</a> Dire Need, Small Rags, Fag-End or
Stump, Bad Payers, and finally, the Via dello Scheletro, or
Skeleton Street.&nbsp; To which there belongs, as is appropriate,
a melancholy legend.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">La Via dello
Scheletro</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There once dwelt in what is now called the Street of
the Skeleton a priest attached to the Cathedral, who was in every
respect all that a good man of his calling and a true Christian
should be, as he was pious, kind-hearted, and charitable, passing
his life in seeking out the poor and teaching their children,
often bringing cases of need and suffering to the knowledge of
wealthier friends&mdash;which thing, were it more frequently done
by all, would do more to put an end to poverty than anything
else.</p>
<p class="poetry"><!-- page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span

everything most human<br />
May highest rise and yet the lowest fall;<br />
And when a brave kind heart meets with <i>the</i> woman,<br />
Our greatest duties seem extremely small,<br />
And those which were the first became the least:<br />
Even so it happened to this gentle priest.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;In the old dwelling where he had
his home,<br />
Which otherwise had been most drear and dull<br />
At morn or eve did oft before him come<br />
A girl as sweet as she was beautiful;<br />
Full soon they learned that both in head and heart<br />
Each was to each the very counterpart.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;There is in every soul of finer
grain<br />
A soul which is in self a soul apart,<br />
Which to itself doth oft deep hid remain,<br />
But leaps to life when Love awakes the heart.<br />
Then as a vapour rises with the sun,<br />
And blends with it, two souls pass into one.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;And so it came that he would
sometimes kiss<br />
Her lovely face, nor seemed it much to prove<br />
That they in anything had done amiss.<br />
Until, one night, there came the kiss of Love, <a
name="citation202"></a><a href="#footnote202"
class="citation">[202]</a><br />
Disguised in friendly seeming like the rest&mdash;<br />
Alas! he drove an arrow to her breast.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;Then came the glow of
passion&mdash;new to both&mdash;<br />
The honeymoon of utter recklessness,<br />
When the most righteous casts away his oath,<br />
And all is lost in sweet forgetfulness,<br />
And life is steeped in joy, without, within,<br />
And rapture seems the sweeter for the sin.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;Then came in its due course the
sad awaking<br />
To life and its grim claims, and all around<br />
They found, in cold grim truth, without mistaking,<br />
These claims for them did terribly abound;<br />
And the poor priest was brought into despair<br />
To find at every turn a foe was there.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;To know our love is pure though
passionate,<br />
And have it judged as if both foul and base,<br />
Doth seem to us the bitterness of fate;<br />
Yet in the world it is the usual case.<br />
By it all priests are judged&mdash;yea, every one&mdash;<br />
Never as Jesus would Himself have done.</p>
<p class="poetry"><!-- page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span

love with passion rings,<br />
Therefore men cry &rsquo;tis <i>all</i> mere sexual sense,<br />

Therefore &rsquo;tis true that, of all sins accurst,<br />

Must leave his woman&mdash;or else lose his soul!</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;Now had this man had money, or if
he,<br />
Like many of his calling, had been bold<br />
With worldly air, then all this misery<br />
Might have been &rsquo;scaped as one escapes the cold<br />
By putting on a sheepskin, warm and fine;<br />
But then hypocrisy was not his line.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;His love was now a mother, and
the truth<br />
Woke in him such a deep and earnest love,<br />
That he would not have left her though in sooth<br />

And so the interdict was soon applied,<br />
But on that day both child and mother died.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;She, poor weak thing, could not
endure the strain,<br />
So flickered out, and all within a day;<br />
And then the priest, without apparent pain,<br />
Began mysteriously to waste away,<br />
And, shadow-like and silent as a mouse,<br />
Men saw him steal into, or from, the house.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;And thinner still and paler yet
he grew,<br />
With every day some life from him seemed gone,<br />
And all aghast, though living, men still knew<br />
He had become a literal skeleton;<br />
And so he died&mdash;in some world less severe<br />
Than this to join the one he held so dear. <a

Or gliding through the court at twilight hour.<br />
But there it still is seen&mdash;and so it came<br />

<p><!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>There is not a word of all this which is
&ldquo;Protestant invention,&rdquo; for though I have poetised or
written up a very rude text, the narrative is strictly as I
received it.&nbsp; There is one point in it worth noticing, that
it is a matter of very general conviction in Italy that in such
matters of Church discipline as are involved in this story, it is
the small flies who are caught in the web, while the great ones
burst buzzing through it without harm, or that the weak and poor
(who are very often those with the best hearts and principles)
are most cruelly punished, where a bold, sensual, vulgar
<i>frate</i> makes light of and easily escapes all
accusations.</p>
<p>There is something sadly and strangely affecting in the
conception of a simply good and loving nature borne down by the
crush of the world and misapplied morality&mdash;or clerical
celibacy&mdash;into total wretchedness&mdash;a diamond dissolved
to air.&nbsp; One in reading this seems to hear the sad words of
one who thought his own name was written in water:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am a shadow now, alas! alas!<br />
Upon the skirts of human nature dwelling<br />
Alone.&nbsp; I chant alone the holy mass,<br />
While little signs of life are round me kneeling,<br />
And glossy bees at noon do fieldward pass,<br />
And many a chapel bell the hour is telling,<br />
Paining me through: those sounds grow strange to me,<br />
And thou art distant in Humanity!&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The following tale is, for reasons which I will subsequently
explain, one of the most remarkable which I have collected:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">La Via del
Fico</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There stood formerly in the Via del Fico a very ancient
palace with a garden, in which there grew a fig-tree which was
said to have grown of itself, or without ever having been
planted.&nbsp; This tree bore much fruit of great beauty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But however proud the owner of the tree was of its
beauty, or however much he might desire to have its fruit,
something always strangely occurred to prevent its being
enjoyed.&nbsp; For when any one was about to pluck it, there
suddenly appeared a great black dog, who, seizing men or women by
their garments, dragged them away, beginning to howl and bay. <a
name="citation205"></a><a href="#footnote205"
class="citation">[205]</a>&nbsp; And then they hurried away and
let the figs alone, in order to make the dog cease his terrible
unearthly baying; for it is believed to be an omen of death when
a dog utters such sounds, it being <!-- page 206--><a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>such a
presage of disaster as when a <i>civetta</i> or small owl hoots
on the roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, it sometimes happened that the dog did not
come, but those who took and ate the figs fared just as badly all
the same.&nbsp; For they soon began to feel ill and suffer dire
pains, and when they had gone into their bedrooms and laid down,
there always entered a beautiful girl clad in white, who began to
whirl round (<i>a girarsi</i>) or spin, making all the time a
great buzzing sound, until horror came over them, which when she
perceived, she vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And many tried also to lop off boughs from the
fig-tree, but they were found the second night replaced by a
perfect new growth with fully ripe fruit.&nbsp; And it was not
the least marvel of the tree that it was always in full leaf,
with abundance of ripe figs on it, even in winter, when there was
snow on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day men digging in the garden found a tablet of
stone or metal on which was inscribed:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Il fico rispettate<br />
E non la toccate,&rsquo;<br />
E non cercate<br />
Neppure mangiarne.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Respect the tree, and let it be,<br />
From branch to root, nor touch its fruit!<br />
Of itself the tree did grow,<br />
From a dog who long ago,<br />
Enchanted by the fairies&rsquo; power,<br />
Was buried here in mystic hour;<br />
Therefore we bid you let it stand,<br />
And if you follow the command<br />
You will be happy all your days,<br />
But woe to him who disobeys!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Now, the owner of the palazzo and garden was a man who
had no faith in old legends, or love for such mysteries as these,
and so he said, &lsquo;It is time to put an end to all this
superstition, and I am determined to at once see whether all my
prosperity depends on a fig-tree; so do you cut it down and tear
it up, root and branch, utterly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was at once done by the labourers, but, while
doing so, they heard sounds as of wailing and great lamenting in
the earth beneath them.&nbsp; And when they, astonished, asked
the signore to listen to the voices, he replied, &lsquo;Away with
your superstitions; we will see this time whether the tree will
grow or return again.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 207--><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>&ldquo;Truly it did not return, but passed away for
ever, and with it all the property and prosperity of the
lord.&nbsp; For in time he had to sell all he had, and, losing
what he got, died in poverty.&nbsp; Then those who had to go in
the street where his palace had been would say, &lsquo;<i>Andiamo
nella Via del Fico</i>,&rsquo; just as they say, &lsquo;<i>Andar
per la Via de&rsquo; Carri</i>,&rsquo; but meaning to &lsquo;go
in the way of what is worthless or poverty-stricken,&rsquo; and
so it was that the street came by its name.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>This strange tale, which is evidently of great antiquity, and
deeply inspired with real witch tradition, has, indeed, nothing
in common with the pretty fairy stories which are so generally
presented as constituting the whole of popular narrative
folklore.&nbsp; It was not made nor intended to serve as a
pleasing tale for youth, but to embody certain ideas which the
witch-teacher explained to the pupil.&nbsp; The first of these
is, that the <i>fig-tree</i> planted under certain circumstances
became a kind of Luck of Eden Hall to its possessor.&nbsp; This
story comes from the Etruscan-Roman land, where traditions have
been preserved with incredible fidelity.&nbsp; In the olden time
Tarquin the Elder planted a fig-tree in a public place in Rome,
and it was a matter of common faith that this tree would flourish
for ever if undisturbed, and that on it depended the prosperity
and preservation of the city. <a name="citation207"></a><a
href="#footnote207" class="citation">[207]</a>&nbsp; And in
India, the motherland of Greek and Roman mythology, it was
believed that whenever one of certain ancient fig-trees died,
that the reigning family would pass away.&nbsp; The opinion was
widely spread that the fig-tree was above all others the one of
life and destiny.&nbsp; In the Bagvatgeta, Krishna says of
himself: &ldquo;I am the spirit, the beginning, the middle, and
the end of creation.&nbsp; I am as the <i>Aswatha</i> (<i>pipal
</i>or Indian fig) among trees.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hence it came that
many Christians believed that the Tree of Life in Eden was not an
apple but a fig-tree.&nbsp; The traditions which establish the
fig-tree as being above all others one on <!-- page 208--><a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>whose
existence that of individuals, families, and states depended, are
extremely numerous and varied.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was,&rdquo;
remarks Alt, &ldquo;not only a symbol of fertility, but an emblem
of ever-renewed and never-extinguished <i>vitality</i>, and one
of eternity, the resurrection, and of the transmigration of the
soul.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the celebrated altar in Ghent, the Tree of
Life is represented as a fig-tree (Menzel, <i>Christliche
Symbolik</i>, i. 277).&nbsp; This universal belief explains why
the fig-tree determines the duration and destiny of lives and
families.</p>
<p>It may have struck the reader as singular that those who eat
of the forbidden figs are punished by the visit of a beautiful
girl who whirls around with a buzzing sound till they are
overcome by awe.&nbsp; Here be it noted first of all, that the
fig, like the pear, is exactly the shape of a top, even the stem
representing the peg.&nbsp; Now, in ancient Latin witchlore or
sorcery, extraordinary magic power, or even sanctity, was
attached to everything which made a humming or buzzing
sound.&nbsp; It was supposed, when properly made, with certain
incantations or instruments, to be capable of throwing people
into a trance.&nbsp; Chief among these instruments was the
top.&nbsp; Thus Horace begs Crattidia to stop the enchantment of
the buzzing top (Ode xv. Book v.).</p>
<p>On this subject I find the following in <i>Diavoli e
Streghe</i>, by Dr. A. Zangolini, 1864:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The <i>rombo</i> <a
name="citation208"></a><a href="#footnote208"
class="citation">[208]</a> is an instrument not unlike the
<i>trottola</i> or peg-top of our boys, called in Latin
<i>turbo</i>, and in common language also
<i>pal&eacute;o</i>.&nbsp; It was believed that with it in
witchcraft a lover could have his head turned with passion, or
that he would be turned at will while it spun.&nbsp; The same
held true of other disks (tee-totums) of wood, iron, or
copper.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This idea was extended to the hum of spinning-wheels, which
aided the conception of the Fates, and the thread <!-- page
209--><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>of
life, to the buzzing of bees and flies, and many other variations
of such sounds.&nbsp; Mr. Andrew Lang has in an admirable paper
shown that the <i>bull-roarer</i> has been regarded as so sacred
among certain savages that women, or the profane, were not
allowed to touch it.&nbsp; A bull-roarer is so easily
constructed, that it is remarkable how few people are familiar
with it.&nbsp; Take a common stick, say six inches in length, tie
a cord three feet long to one end, and, grasping the other, whirl
it round, with the result of astonishing all to whom it is not
familiar by its sound:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;First it is but a gentle hum,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like bird-song warbling in the trees,<br />
Then like a torrent it doth foam,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And then a wild and roaring breeze.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When vigorously spun, it may be heard of a calm evening for a
mile, and its effect is then indescribably&mdash;I will not say,
as most novelists here would, &ldquo;<i>weird</i>,&rdquo; for I
do not know that it prophesies anything, but it is certainly most
suggestive of something mysterious.</p>
<p>Therefore the bayadere, with her spinning <i>pas seul</i> and
buzzing <i>romore</i>, who appears to the eater of the figs, is
the magic top in person, her form being taken from the fig.&nbsp;
The connection of the enchanted dog with the tree is not so
clear, but it may be observed that there is a vast mass of
tradition which makes the black dog a <i>chthonic</i>, that is, a
subterranean or under-earthly symbol, and that in this story he
comes out of the earth.&nbsp; This animal was a special favourite
of Hecate-Diana of the world below, the queen of all the
witches.</p>
<p>There is a vast quantity of folklore in reference to the fig
as an emblem of fertility, reproduction, and sensual affinity,
and, on the other side, of its being an emblem often used in
proverbs to express the very contrary, or trifling value,
worthlessness, and poverty.&nbsp; Thus, the barren fig-tree of
the New Testament had a deep signification to all who were
familiar with these poetic and <!-- page 210--><a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>mystic
&ldquo;correspondences.&rdquo;&nbsp; The reader has probably
observed that in this story there is, as in a parable, a strong
intimation of symbolism, or as if more were meant than meets the
ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remains to be said,&rdquo; that the putting the thumb
between the index and middle finger, which was regarded with awe
by the Romans as driving away evil spirits, was called
&ldquo;making the fig,&rdquo; or <i>far la castagna</i>, to make
the chestnut&mdash;in Latin, <i>medium ostendere
digitum</i>.&nbsp; The same sign as the fig to drive away devils
became a deadly insult when made at any one, as if he were a
wizard and accursed.&nbsp; It had also a jeering and indecent
meaning.&nbsp; It has been said that the fig, as a synonym for
anything worthless, originated from the great abundance and
cheapness of the fruit in Greece, but this is very
unsatisfactory, since it would apply as well to olives or
grain.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;This tale doth teach,&rdquo; notes the learned Flaxius,
&ldquo;as regards the folklore of the black dog, that in this
life most things are good or bad, as we take them.&nbsp; For the
black dog, Monsieur, of Cornelius Agrippa (like that in Faust)
was a demon, albeit his pupil, Wierus, records that he himself
knew the animal well, but never supposed there was aught of the
goblin in it.&nbsp; And this same Wierus has mentioned (<i>loc.
cit.</i>, p. m. 325), that one of the things which most terrify
the devil and all his gang is the blood of a black dog splashed
on the wall.&nbsp; So in ancient symbolism death meant life, the
two being correlative, and in witchcraft the spell of the frog
and many more are meant to do deadly harm, or great good,
according to the way in which they are worked.&nbsp; Wherein lies
an immense moral lesson for ye all.&nbsp; Remember,
children&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There is no passion, vice, or
crime,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which truly, closely understood,<br />
Does not, in the full course of time,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Do far less harm than good.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the most picturesque medi&aelig;val palaces in Florence
is that of the Feroni, and its architectural beauty is greatly
enhanced by its fine situation at the head of the Tornabuoni on
the Piazza della Trinit&agrave;, with the magnificent column of
the Medicis just before its gate.&nbsp; According to Italian
authority, &ldquo;this palace may be called, after those of the
Pr&aelig;torio (<i>i.e.</i>, Bargello) and the Signoria, the most
characteristic building of its epoch in Florence.&nbsp; It is
said to have been built by Arnolfo di Cambio.&nbsp; It once
belonged to the Spini, from whom it passed to the
Feroni.&rdquo;&nbsp; When I was in Florence in 1846&ndash;47,
this palace was the best hotel in Florence, and the one in which
I lived.&nbsp; There have been great &ldquo;restorations&rdquo;
in the city since that time, but very few which have not been
most discreditably and foolishly conducted, even to the utter
destruction of all that was truly interesting in them; as, for
instance, &ldquo;the house of Dante, torn down within a few years
to be rebuilt, so that now not one stone rests upon another of
the original;&rdquo; and &ldquo;Santa Maria Novella, where the
usual monkish hatred of everything not <i>rococo</i> and trashy
has shown itself by destroying beautiful work of earlier times,
or selling it to the Kensington Museum, <!-- page 212--><a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>setting up
a barbarously gilt gingerbread high altar, and daubing the
handsome Gothic sacristy with gaudy colours.&rdquo;&nbsp; To
which the author of Murray&rsquo;s &ldquo;Guide-Book for Central
Italy&rdquo; adds, that &ldquo;perhaps on the whole list of
ecclesiastical restorations there does not exist a more
deplorable instance of monastic vandalism than has been
perpetrated here by the architect Romoli&rdquo;&mdash;a remark
which falls unfortunately very far short of the truth.&nbsp; Such
ruin is wrought <i>everywhere</i> at present; witness the
beautiful Fonte Gaja, &ldquo;the masterpiece of Jacopo della
Quercia in Siena (1402), which, since the change of Government,
was not &lsquo;restored,&rsquo; but <i>totally destroyed and
carted away</i>, a miserable modern copy having been recently set
up in its place&rdquo; (Hare, &ldquo;Cities of Central
Italy&rdquo;), all of which was probably done to &ldquo;make a
job&rdquo; for a favoured builder.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what can you
expect,&rdquo; adds a friend, &ldquo;in a country where it is
common to cover a beautiful dry stone wall with plaster, and then
paint it over to resemble the original stone,&rdquo; because, as
I was na&iuml;vely told, &ldquo;the rough stone itself looks
<i>too cheap</i>&rdquo;?&nbsp; Anybody who has lived long in
Italy can add infinitely to such instances.&nbsp; The Palazzo
Feroni has, however, suffered so little, for a wonder, from
restoration, and still really looks so genuinely old, that it
deserves special mention, and may serve as an excuse for my
remarks on the manner in which ancient works are destroyed so
<i>con amore</i> by monks and modern municipalities.&nbsp; I may
here note that this building is, in a sense, the common
rendezvous for all the visitors to Florence, chiefly English and
Americans, since in it are the very large circulating library and
reading-rooms of Vieusseux. <a name="citation212"></a><a
href="#footnote212" class="citation">[212]</a></p>
<p>There is, of course, a legend attached to the Palazzo Feroni,
and it is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 213--><a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span><span
class="smcap">Il Palazzo Feroni</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Signore Pietro, who afterwards received the name
Feroni, was a very rich man, and yet hated by the poor, on whom
he bestowed nothing, and not much liked by his equals, though he
gave them costly entertainments; for there was in all the man and
in his character something inconsistent and contradictory, or of
<i>corna contra croce</i>&mdash;&lsquo;the horns against the
cross,&rsquo; as the proverb hath it, which made it so that one
never knew where to have him:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Un, al monte, e l&rsquo;altro al
pian,<br />
Quel che, &egrave; oggi, non &egrave; doman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;On the hill in joy, in the dale in
sorrow&mdash;<br />
One thing to-day, and another to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;For to take him at every point, there was something to
count off.&nbsp; Thus in all the city there was no
one&mdash;according to his own declaration&mdash;who was</p>
<p>Richer or more prosperous,</p>
<p>Or who had enjoyed a better education,</p>
<p>Or who had such remarkable general knowledge of everything
taking place,</p>
<p>Or more of a distinguished courtier,</p>
<p>Or one with such a train of dependants, and people of all
kinds running after him,</p>
<p>Or more generally accomplished,</p>
<p>Or better looking&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And finally, no one so physically strong, as he was
accustomed to boast to everybody on first acquaintance, and give
them proofs of it&mdash;he having heard somewhere that
&lsquo;physical force makes a deeper impression than
courtesy.&rsquo;&nbsp; But all these fine gifts failed to inspire
respect (and here was another puzzle in his nature), either
because he was so tremendously vain that he looked down on all
mortals as so many insects, and all pretty much alike as compared
to himself, or else from a foolish carelessness and want of
respect, he made himself quite as familiar with trivial people as
with anybody. <a name="citation213"></a><a href="#footnote213"
class="citation">[213]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;One evening the Signore Pietro gave a grand ball in his
palace, and as the guests came in&mdash;the beauty and grace and
<!-- page 214--><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>courtly style of all Italy in its golden time&mdash;he
half closed his eyes, lazily looking at the brilliant swarm of
human butterflies and walking flowers, despising while admiring
them, though if he had been asked to give a reason for his
contempt he would have been puzzled, not having any great amount
of self-respect for himself.&nbsp; And they spun round and round
in the dance. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;When all at once he saw among the guests a lady,
unknown to him, of such striking and singular appearance as to
rouse him promptly from his idle thought.&nbsp; She was indeed
wonderfully beautiful, but what was very noticeable was her
absolutely ivory white complexion, which hardly seemed human, her
profuse black silken hair; and most of all her unearthly large
jet-black eyes, of incredible brilliancy, with such a strange
expression as neither the Signore Pietro nor any one else present
had ever seen before.&nbsp; There was a power in them, a kind of
basilisk-fascination allied to angelic sweetness&mdash;fire and
ice . . . <i>ostra e tramontan</i>&mdash;a hot and cold wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Signore Pietro, with his prompt tact, made the
lady&rsquo;s paleness a pretence for addressing her.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Did she feel ill&mdash;everything in the house was at her
disposition&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Servants, carpets, chairs and
tables,<br />
Kitchen, pantry, hall and stables,<br />
Everything above or under;<br />
All my present earthly plunder,<br />
All too small for such a wonder.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The lady, with a smile and a glance in which there was
not the slightest trace of being startled or abashed,
replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis not worth while your
house to rifle,<br />
<i>O mio Signor</i>, for such a trifle.<br />
&rsquo;Tis but a slight indisposition,<br />
For which I&rsquo;ll rest, by your permission.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Signore Pietro, as an improvisatore, was delighted
with such a ready answer, and remarking that he was something of
a doctor, begged permission to bring a soothing cordial,
admirable for the nerves, which he hoped to have the honour of
placing directly in that fairy-like hand. . . .&nbsp; The Signore
vanished to seek the <i>calmante</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The guests had begun by this time to notice this lady,
and from her extremely strange appearance they gathered round
her, expecting at first to have some sport in listening to, <!--
page 215--><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>or quizzing, an eccentric or a character.&nbsp; But
they changed their mind as they came to consider her&mdash;some
feeling an awe as if she were a <i>fata</i>, and all being
finally convinced that whoever she was she had come there to
<i>sell</i> somebody amazingly cheap, nor did they feel quite
assured that they themselves were not included in the
bargain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Signore Pietro returned with the soothing cordial;
he had evidently not drunk any of it himself while on the errand,
for there was a massive chased iron table inlaid with gold and
silver in his way, and the mighty lord with an angry blow from
his giant arm, like one from a blacksmith&rsquo;s No. 1 hammer,
broke it, adding an artisan-like oath, and knocked it over.&nbsp;
Flirtation had begun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Did you hurt yourself, Signore?&rsquo; asked the
lady amiably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not I, indeed,&rsquo; he replied proudly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;A Stone is my name, but it ought to have been Iron, lady,
for I am hard as nails, a regular Ferrone or big man of iron, and
all my ancestors were Ferroni too; ah! we are a strong
lot&mdash;at your service!&rsquo;&nbsp; Saying this he handed the
cup to the lady, who drank the potion, and then, instead of
giving the goblet back to the Signore Pietro, as he expected,
meaning to gallantly drink off <i>les doux restes</i>, she
beckoned with her finger and an upward scoop of her hand to the
table, which was lying disconsolately on its back with its legs
upwards, like a trussed chicken waiting to be carved, when lo! at
the signal it jumped up and came walking to her like a Christian,
its legs moving most humanly, and yet all present were appalled
at the sight, and the Signore gasped&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I believe the devil&rsquo;s in it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lady composedly placed the draught on the table and
smiled benevolently.&nbsp; There was something in that angelic
smile which made the Signore feel as if he had been made game
of.&nbsp; In a rage he rushed at the table, which reared up on
its hind legs and showed fight with its forepaws, on which there
were massy round iron balls, as on the other extremities.&nbsp;
Truly it was a desperate battle, and both combatants covered
themselves with dust and glory.&nbsp; Now the table would put a
ball well in, and the Signore would counter, or, as I may say,
cannon or cannon-ball it off; and then they would grapple and
roll over and over till the Signora called them to time.&nbsp; At
last the lord wrenched all the cannon-balls off from the table,
which first, making a jump to the ceiling, came down in its usual
position, while the balls began dancing on it like mad.</p>
<p><!-- page 216--><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>&ldquo;At such a sight all present roared with
laughter, and it was observed that the lady, no longer pale,
flushed with merriment like a rose.&nbsp; As for Signore Pietro
he was red as a beet, and heaved out that he had been
<i>canzonato</i> or quizzed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Truly yes,&rsquo; replied the lady; &lsquo;but
henceforth you shall have a name, for to do you justice you are
as hard as iron, and Iron you shall be called&mdash;Big Iron
Ferrone&mdash;and cannon-balls shall be your coat-of-arms, <i>in
s&aelig;cula s&aelig;culorum</i>.&nbsp; By edict of the Queen of
the Fairies!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now at this all the love in the Signore Pietro
concentrated itself in his heart, passed into his tongue, and
caused him to burst forth in song in the following <i>ottava</i>,
while the music accompanied:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Quando vedo le femmine rammone,<br
/>
Mi sento andare il cuore in convulsione,<br />
Hanno certe facette vispe e sane,<br />
Da fare entrare in sen la tentazione,<br />
Oh donnina!&nbsp; Non siate disumana!<br />
Di Pietro abbiate compassione!<br />
Scusante la modestia se l&rsquo;e troppo<br />
Di questi personali non sene poppo.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When I behold thy all too lovely features,<br />
I feel my heart in soft convulsions heaving,<br />
Thou art the most entrancing of all creatures,<br />
I tell you so in sooth, without deceiving,<br />
In fact there is no beauty which can beat yours;<br />
And Pietro loves you, lady, past believing;<br />
In breasts like cannon-balls there&rsquo;s naught to blame;<br />
But oh!&nbsp; I hope your heart&rsquo;s not like the
same!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;But as this exquisite poem concluded with an immense
sigh, there appeared before them a golden and pearl car, in which
the fairy entered, and rising sailed away through a great hole in
the ceiling, which opened before and closed behind her, Signore
Pietro remaining <i>a bocca aperta</i>, gaping with opened jaws,
till all was o&rsquo;er.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well!&rsquo; exclaimed the master, &lsquo;she
gave me the slip, but we have had a jolly evening of it, and
I&rsquo;m the first man who ever fought an iron table, and
I&rsquo;ve got a good idea.&nbsp; My name is now Feroni&mdash;the
Big Iron Man&mdash;ladies and gentlemen, please remember, and
cannon-balls are in my coat-of-arms!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I have naturally taken some liberty as regards mere text in
translating this tale, in order to render the <!-- page 217--><a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>better the
spirit of the original; but not so much as may be supposed, and
spirit and words are, on the whole, accurately rendered.</p>
<p>The reader is not to suppose that there are any traces of true
history in this fairy tale.&nbsp; I am very greatly indebted to
Miss Wyndham of Florence (who has herself made collections in
folk-lore), for investigating this subject of the Feroni family,
with the following result&mdash;it being premised that it had
occurred to the lady that the &ldquo;cannon-balls&rdquo; or
Medicean pills, or pawnbroker&rsquo;s sign, whatever it was, had
been attributed by mistake to the Feroni.&nbsp; Miss Wyndham,
after consulting with authority, found that the Feroni themselves
had not the balls, but, owing probably to transfer of property,
there is found on their palaces the Alessandri shield, on which
the upper half and lower left quarter contain the Medici
spheres.&nbsp; She also sent me this extract from the old work,
<i>Marietta di Ricci</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Feroni family, originally named from
Balducci da Vinci, and of peasant origin, owes its fortune to
Francesco, son of Baldo di Paolo di Ferone, a dyer of
Empoli.&nbsp; Going as a merchant to Holland, he accumulated a
large fortune.&nbsp; Made known to Cosimo III. (just called to
the Grand Duchy) by his travels, he was called to Florence.&nbsp;
In 1673 he was made citizen of Florence, in 1674 he was elected
senator, and in 1681 appointed Marquis of Bellavista.&nbsp; He
left a colossal fortune, which has been kept up by his heirs to
the present day.&nbsp; His grandson Guiseppe was made cardinal in
1753.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their arms are an arm mailed in iron, holding a sword,
and above it a golden lily in a blue field.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This extract is interesting, as showing how a family could
rise by industry and wealth, even in one generation, by the work
of a single man, to the highest honours in Florence.&nbsp; And it
is very remarkable that some impression of the origin of this
vigorous artisan and merchant, of peasant stock, is evident in
the tale.&nbsp; He is there clever <!-- page 218--><a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>and strong,
but vulgar and familiar, so that he was not personally
liked.&nbsp; He remains standing open-mouthed, like a comic
actor, when the fairy vanishes.&nbsp; In fact the whole tale
suggests the elements of a humorous melodrama or operetta, a
<i>bourgeois gentilhomme</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And should it come to pass that any read<br
/>
This tale in Viesseux, his library,<br />
In the Feroni palace, let them think<br />
That, even in the rooms where they do read,<br />
The things which I have told once came to pass&mdash;<br />
Even so the echo ever haunts the shrine!&rdquo;</p>

<h2><!-- page 219--><a name="page219"></a><span

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The church of San Gaetano, on the left of
the Via Tornabuoni, faces the Palazzo Antinori, built by Giuliano
di San Gallo.&nbsp; Opposite is the Via delle Belle Donne, a
name, says Leigh Hunt, which it is a sort of tune to
pronounce.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hare</span>,
<i>Cities of Central Italy</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The name of this place is suggestive of a story of some kind,
but it was a long time before I obtained the following relative
to the Street of Pretty Women:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the Via delle Belle Donne there was a very large old
house in which were many lodgers, male and female, who, according
to their slender means, had two rooms for a family.&nbsp; Among
these were many very pretty girls, some of them seamstresses,
others corset-makers, some milliners, all employed in shops, who
worked all day and then went out in the evening to carry their
sewing to the <i>maggazini</i>.&nbsp; And it was from them that
the street got its name, for it became so much the fashion to go
and look at them that young men would say, &lsquo;<i>Andiamo
nella Via delle Belle Donne</i>,&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Let us go to
the Street of the Pretty Women;&rsquo; so it has been so-called
to this day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when they sallied forth they were at once
surrounded or joined by young men, who sought their company with
views more or less honourable, as is usual.&nbsp; Among these
there was a very handsome and wealthy signore named Adolfo, who
was so much admired that he might have had his choice of all
these belles, but he had fixed his mind on one, a beautiful
blonde, who was, indeed, the fairest among them all.&nbsp; She
had large black eyes, with quick glances, beautiful light hair in
masses, and was always dressed simply, yet with natural
elegance.&nbsp; She had long avoided making acquaintance among
men, and she now shunned Adolfo; but at last he succeeded, after
many difficulties, in becoming acquainted, and finally won her
heart&mdash;the end of it all being the old story of a poor girl
ruined by a gay and great signor, left a mother, and then
abandoned.</p>
<p><!-- page 220--><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>&ldquo;For four years she lived alone, by her work,
with her child, who grew up to be a very beautiful boy.&nbsp;
Then he, noting that other children had parents, asked her
continually, &lsquo;Mamma, where is my papa?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He gave her no rest, and at last she went to Adolfo and
asked him what he would do for their child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He laughed at her, and said, &lsquo;Nothing.&nbsp; That
folly is all over.&nbsp; Begone!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, in a wild passion of rage at seeing her child so
despised, she stabbed him to the heart, and escaped unseen and
undiscovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, when the boy asked her again:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cara madre, cara madre,<br />
Dove e lo mio padre?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mother dear, tell to me<br />
Where may my father be?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;She replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Darling son, thy sire is dead,<br />
Lying in an earthen bed;<br />
Dead he ever will remain,<br />
By my dagger he was slain.<br />
Had he but been kind to thee,<br />

<p>The following ballad may be classed as Florentine, since it
was in Florence that I heard it sung, but it is not attached to
any particular place.&nbsp; It is one of those compositions which
are either sung or simply recited, and quite as often intoned in
a manner which is neither singing nor speaking.&nbsp; In such
chant, when a rhyme happens to fall in by chance, the utmost is
made of it by dwelling on the word or drawling it out.&nbsp;
Sometimes, as in the following, there are verses of four lines
each, but only the concluding line of every verse rhymes,
<i>i.e.</i>, with the preceding last line of the previous
stanza:</p>

<p>It may have happened to the reader, in his travels, to trace
in some majestic mountain-land, amid rocky ravines, that which
was, perhaps, in prehistoric times a terrible torrent or a
roaring river.&nbsp; I mean, indeed, such a furious flood as is
now unknown on earth, one which tore away the highest hills like
trifles, melting them in a minute to broad alluvials, and ground
up the grandest granite cliffs to gravel-dust, even as a mighty
mill grates grain to flour.</p>
<p>You trace the course of the ancient river which when young
vaulted the valley, which it had made, on either side with
overhanging precipices, which now bend like silent mourners over
its grave.&nbsp; And it seems to be dead and buried for ever.</p>
<p>Yet it may chance that, looking more deeply into its course to
see if, perhaps, some flakes of antique gold are not to be found
in the bed of the old water-course, you hear deep in some rocky
crevice far below, and out of sight, the merry gurgle or
voice-like murmur of a spring or unseen rivulet which indicates
that the river of ancient days is not quite lost in the
land.&nbsp; Unsuspected, like the <!-- page 226--><a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>sapphire
serpent of Eastern legend, that diamond-clear rivulet has wound
its mysterious course deep in the earth for ages, and, following
its sound, you may come to some place where it again leaps forth
into sunlight&mdash;little, indeed, yet ever beautiful.&nbsp; It
is almost touching to see that diminished rill creeping timidly
round the feet of giant boulders which it once rent in sport from
the mighty rocks, and rolled into what were for it in its whilom
power, mere marbles.&nbsp; It is small now, and very obscure, yet
it lives and is ever beautiful.</p>
<p>Such a stream, which I traced yesterday in an ancient gorge in
the heart of the Apennines, where the grey tower of Rocca looks
down on the mysterious Ponte del Diavolo of the twelfth
century&mdash;the most picturesque bridge in Italy&mdash;forcibly
reminds me of the human stream of old tradition which once, as
marvellous mythology or grand religion, roared and often raged
over all this region, driving before it, and rending away, all
the mighty rocks of human will, now tearing down and anon forming
stupendous cliffs of observances, and vast monoliths of legend
and faith.&nbsp; Such were the Etruscan and early Roman cults,
which drove before them and engulfed irresistibly all the
institutions of their time, and then disappeared so utterly that
men now believe that the only remaining record of their existence
is in their tombs or rocky relics of strange monuments.</p>
<p>But by bending low to earth, or seeking among the people, we
may hear the murmur of a hidden stream of legend and song which,
small and shrunken as it may be, is still the veritable river of
the olden time.&nbsp; Many such streams are running in many
lands, and that full openly on the earth&rsquo;s surface, but
this to which I specially refer is strangely occult and deeply
hidden, for to find it we must seek among the <i>strege</i> and
<i>stregoni</i>, or witches and sorcerers, who retain as dark
secrets of their own, marvellous relics of the myths of the early
ages.&nbsp; These are, <!-- page 227--><a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>in many
cases, so strangely quaint and beautiful that they would seem to
have kept something of an original perfume which has utterly
perished in the dried flowers of tradition preserved in books, or
even by poets.</p>
<p>This seems to me to be the case with the incantation to
Orpheus, which is now before me, written in rude dialect, which
indicates, so to speak, the depth of the earth from which it was
taken.&nbsp; I had asked the woman who gave it to me whether she
knew such a name as that of Orpheus or Orfeo, as connected with
music.&nbsp; This was the reply which I received:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Orfeo</span>.</p>
<p><i>Scongiurazione a Orfeo per suonare bene uno

I cannot play the flageolet;<br />

The rattling drum and loud trombone;<br />

And that its tones may sweetly sound,<br />

From the dark realm thou couldst not free,<br />
To grant me of thy mighty will<br />
That I may play this pipe with skill,<br />
Even as thou hast played before;<br />
For, as the story runs, of yore,<br />
Whenever thou didst wake its sound,<br />
The forest beasts came raptured round.<br />
Orpheus! Orpheus!&nbsp; I pray,<br />
Orpheus! teach me how to play!<br />
<!-- page 230--><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

I owe it all to thee alone,<br />
And of the wondrous skill I&rsquo;ll tell,<br />
Which mighty Orpheus won from hell.<br />
And by the music, and the power,<br />
Of passion in me, from this hour<br />
Henceforth in this sweet instrument<br />
I shall be ever well content;<br />
For now, I do remember well,<br />
What &rsquo;twas my father oft would tell,<br />
That all who would learn music thus<br />
Must conjure mighty Orpheus,<br />
Even as I have done to-day,<br />
So I to him will ever pray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which the manuscript adds in prose:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thus the peasants do when they do not
succeed in playing the shepherd&rsquo;s pipe, which they esteem
beyond any other instrument.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To any one who fully feels and understands what is meant to be
conveyed by this incantation&mdash;and a great deal is expressed
by passionate singing and a deep thrilling intonation which the
text does not give&mdash;my translation will appear to be quite
accurate.&nbsp; But, in any case, no scholar or poet can deny
that there is in it a strange depth of classic feeling, or of old
Roman romance, not strained at second-hand through books, but
evidently drawn from rude antiquity, which is as fresh in its
ring as it is marvellous.</p>
<p>It may be observed as exquisitely curious that in this
incantation the peasant who wishes to become a skilled performer
on the flageolet <i>buries it for three days in the ground</i>,
invoking Orpheus by what the spirit suffered in losing Eurydice,
and subsequently distinctly declaring <!-- page 231--><a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>that he won
or conjured his great musical power from Hades, which means that
by the penance and loss, and his braving the terrors of the
Inferno, he gained <i>skill</i>.&nbsp; This is a mighty element
of the myth in all its forms, in all ages, in every
country.&nbsp; The burying the instrument for three days probably
typifies the three days during which Orpheus was in hell.</p>
<p>It may be observed that Eurydice has become <i>Auradice</i> in
the incantation, in which there is probably an intimation of
<i>Aura</i>, a light wind or zephyr.&nbsp; Air is so naturally
associated with music.&nbsp; This, by a very singular
coincidence, yet certainly due to mere chance, recalls the
invocation to the Spirit of the Air, given by Bulwer in
&ldquo;The Last Days of Pompeii&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Spectre of the viewless air,<br />
Hear the blind Thessalian&rsquo;s prayer,<br />
By Erichtho&rsquo;s art that shed<br />
Dews of life when life was fled,<br />
By lone Ithaca&rsquo;s wise king,<br />
Who could wake the crystal spring<br />
To the voice of prophecy<br />
<i>By the lost Eurydice</i>!<br />
Summoned from the shadowy throng,<br />
At the muse-son&rsquo;s magic song:<br />
Come, wild Demon of the Air,<br />
Answer to thy votary&rsquo;s prayer.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is indeed very remarkable that in the call to the God of
Music, who is in certain wise a spirit of the air, as in that to
the Spirit of the Air himself, both are invoked:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;By the lost Eurydice!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it could be shown that Bulwer owed this poem and allusion
to any ancient work or tradition, I should be tempted to believe
that the popular invocation was derived from some source in
common with the latter.&nbsp; There is indeed a quaint na&iuml;ve
drollery in the word
<i>Aura</i>dice&mdash;&ldquo;Air-tell!&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Air-declare!&rdquo; which adapts it better to the spirit
of Bulwer&rsquo;s poem, in which the air is begged to <!-- page
232--><a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>tell something, than to the Orphean or Orphic
spell.&nbsp; It may be that the Orphic oracles were heard in the
voice of the wind, apropos of which latter there is a strange
Italian legend and an incantation to be addressed to all such
mystic voices of the night, which almost seems re-echoed in
&ldquo;Lucia&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Verrano a te sull&rsquo; aure,<br />
I miei sospiri ardenti,<br />
Udrai nell mar che mormora<br />
L&rsquo;eco de miei lamenti!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is worth observing that this tradition, though derived from
the Romagna, was given to me in Florence, and that one of the
sculptures on the Campanile represents Orpheus playing the pipe
to wild beasts.&nbsp; It is said that in the Middle Ages the
walls of churches were the picture-books of the people, where
they learned all they knew of Bible legends, but not unfrequently
gathered many strange tales from other sources.&nbsp; The
sculptors frequently chose of their own will scenes or subjects
which were well known to the multitude, who would naturally be
pleased with the picturing what they liked, and it may be that
Orpheus was familiar then to all.&nbsp; In any case, the finding
him in a witch incantation is singularly in accordance with the
bas-relief of the Cathedral of Florence, which again fits in
marvellously well with Byron&rsquo;s verse:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Florence! whom I will love as well<br />
As ever yet was said or sung,<br />
Since Orpheus sang his spouse from hell,<br />
Whilst thou art fair and I am young.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sweet Florence! those were pleasant times,<br />
When worlds were staked for ladies&rsquo; eyes.<br />
Had bards as many realms as rhymes,<br />
Thy charms might raise new Antonies!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>True it is that <i>this</i> Florence seems to have had
dazzling eyes and ringlets curled; and it is on the other hand
not true that Orpheus sang his spouse from hell&mdash;he only
<!-- page 233--><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>tried to do it.&nbsp; And it is worth noting that one
of the commonest halfpenny pamphlets sold in Florence, which is
to be found at every public stand, is a poem called
&ldquo;Orpheus and Eurydice.&rdquo;&nbsp; This fact alone renders
it less singular that such classical incantations should
exist.</p>
<p>The early Christians, notwithstanding their antipathy to
heathen symbols, retained with love that of Orpheus.&nbsp;
Orpheus was represented as a gentle youth, charming-wild beasts
with the music of the pipe, or as surrounded by them and sheep;
hence he was, like the Good Shepherd, the favourite type of
Christ.&nbsp; He had also gone down into shadowy Hades, and
returned to be sacrificed by the heathen, unto whose rites he
would not conform.</p>
<p>Miss Roma Lister found traces of Orpheus among the peasantry
about Rome, in a pretty tradition.&nbsp; They say that there is a
spirit who, when he plays the <i>zufolo</i> or flageolet to
flocks, attracts them by his music and keeps them quiet.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Now there were certain shepherd families
and their flocks together in a place, and it was agreed that
every night by turns, each family should guard the flocks of all
the rest.&nbsp; But it was observed that one mysterious family
all turned in and went to sleep when their turn came to watch,
and yet every morning every sheep was in its place.&nbsp; Then it
was found that this family had a spirit who played the
<i>zufolo</i>, and herded the flock by means of his
music.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The name is wanting, but Orpheus was there.&nbsp; The survival
of the soul of Orpheus in the <i>zufolo</i> or pipe, and in the
sprite, reveals the mystic legend which indicates his existing to
other times.&nbsp; In this it is said that his head after death
predicted to Cyrus the Persian monarch that he too would be
killed by a woman (<i>Consule Leonic</i>, <i>de var. histor.</i>,
lib. i. cap. 17; <i>de Orphei Tumulo in monte Olympo</i>,
&amp;c., cited by <i>Kornmann de Miraculis Mortuorum</i>, cap.
19).&nbsp; The legend of Orpheus, or of a living wife returning
from another world to visit an afflicted <!-- page 234--><a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>husband,
passed to other lands, as may be seen in a book by Georgius
Sabinus, <i>in Notis ad Metamorp</i>.&nbsp; <i>Ovidii</i>, lib.
x. <i>de descensu Orphei ad Inferos</i>, in which he tells how a
Bavarian lady, after being buried, was so moved by her
husband&rsquo;s grief that she came to life again, and lived with
him for many years, <i>semper tamen fuisse tristem ac
pallidem</i>&mdash;but was always sad and pale.&nbsp; However,
they got on very well together for a long time, till one evening
<i>post vesperi potum</i>&mdash;after he had taken his evening
drink&mdash;being somewhat angry at the housemaid, he scolded her
with unseemly words.&nbsp; Now it was the condition of his
wife&rsquo;s coming back to life and remaining with him that he
was never to utter an improper expression (<i>ut que deinceps
ipse abstineret blasphemis conviciandi verbis</i>).&nbsp; And
when the wife heard her husband swear, she disappeared, soul and
body, and that in such a hurry that her dress (which was
certainly of fine old stiff brocade) was found standing up, and
her shoes under it.&nbsp; A similar legend, equally authentic,
may be found in the &ldquo;Breitmann Ballads,&rdquo; a work, I
believe, by an American author.&nbsp; On which subject the
learned Flaxius remarks that &ldquo;if all the men who swear
after their evening refreshments were to lose their wives,
widowers would become a drug in the market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the connection between <i>aura</i> as air, and as an
<i>air</i> in music, I have something curious to note.&nbsp;
Since the foregoing was written I bought in Florence a large
wooden cup, it may be of the eleventh century or earlier, known
as a <i>misura</i>, or measure for grain, formerly called a
<i>modio</i>, in Latin <i>modus</i>, which word has the double
meaning of measure for objects solid or liquid, and also for
music.&nbsp; Therefore there are on the wooden measure four
female figures, each holding a musical instrument, and all with
their garments blowing in one direction, as in a high wind,
doubtless to signify <i>aura</i>, Italian <i>aria</i>, air or
melody.&nbsp; These madonnas of the four <i>modes</i> are rudely
but very <!-- page 235--><a name="page235"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 235</span>gracefully sketched by a bold
master-hand.&nbsp; They represent, in fact, Eurydice
quadrupled.</p>
<p>There is a spirit known in the Toscana Romagna as
<i>Turabug</i>.&nbsp; He is the guardian of the reeds or canes,
or belongs to them like the ancient Syrinx.&nbsp; There is a
curious ceremony and two invocations referring to him.&nbsp; Ivy
and rue are specially sacred to him.&nbsp; One of these two
invocations is solely in reference to playing the <i>zufolo</i>,
partly that the applicant may be inspired to play well, and
secondly, because the spirit is supposed to be attracted by the
sound of the instrument.&nbsp; The very ancient and beautiful
idea that divinities are invoked or attracted by music, is still
found in the use of the organ in churches.</p>
<p>A large portion of the foregoing on Orpheus formed, with
&ldquo;Intialo,&rdquo; the subject of a paper by me in Italian,
which was read in the Collegio Romana at Rome at the first
meeting of the Italian <i>Societa Nazionale per le Tradizioni
Popolari Italiani</i>, in November 1893.&nbsp; Of which society I
may here mention that it is under the special patronage of her
Majesty Margherita the Queen of Italy, who is herself a zealous
and accomplished folklorist and collector&mdash;&ldquo;special
patronage&rdquo; meaning here not being a mere figurehead, but
first officer&mdash;and that the president is Count Angelo de
Gubernatis.</p>
<p>I believe that the establishment of this society will
contribute vastly to shake in Italy the old-fashioned belief that
to be a person of the <i>most</i> respectable learning it is
quite sufficient to be thoroughly acquainted with a few
&ldquo;classic&rdquo; writers, be they Latin, French, or Italian,
and that it is almost a crime to read anything which does not
directly serve as a model or a copy whereby to &ldquo;refine our
style.&rdquo;&nbsp; As regards which the whole world is now
entering on a new renaissance, the conflict between the stylists
and the more liberally enlightened having already begun.</p>
<p><!-- page 236--><a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

soon turned into a diabolical sorcerer; and Leloyer writes of
him: &ldquo;He was the greatest wizard who ever lived, and his
writings boil over with praises of devils and filthy loves of
gods and mortals, . . . who were all only devils and
witches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That Eve brought death and sin into the world by eating one
apple, or a fig, or orange, or Chinese nectarine, or the fruit of
the banana tree, or a pear, a peach, or everything pomological,
if we are to believe all translators of the Bible, coincides
strongly with the fact that Eurydice was lost for tasting a
pomegranate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of the precise graft of the espalier of
Eden,&rdquo; says the author of the &lsquo;Ingoldsby
Legends,&rsquo; &ldquo;Sanchoniathon, Manetho, and Berosus are
undecided; the best informed Talmudists have, however . . .
pronounced it a Ribstone pippin,&rdquo; Eve being a rib.&nbsp;
The ancients were happy in being certain that their apple was one
of Granada.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>H&aelig;c fabula docet</i>,&rdquo;
writes our Flaxius, &ldquo;that mysteries abound in every
myth.&nbsp; Now, whether Orpheus was literally the first man who
ever went to hell for a woman I know not, but well I ween that he
was not the last, as the majority of French novelists of the
present day are chiefly busy in proving, very little, as it seems
to me, either to the credit of their country or of
themselves.&nbsp; But there are others who read in this tale a
dark and mysterious forewarning to the effect that ladies
<i>&agrave; la mode</i> who fall in love with Italian musicians
or music-masters, and especially those who let themselves and
their fortunes be <i>siffl&eacute;es</i> (especially the
fortunes), should not be astonished when the fate of Eurydice
befalls them.&nbsp; Pass on, beloved, to another tale!</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Walk on, amid these mysteries strange and
old,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The strangest of them all is yet
to come!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<span class="smcap">the spirit of the haunting shadow</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O ombra che dalla luce siei uscita,<br />
Misuri il passo al Sole, all&rsquo;uom la vita.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Umbram suam m&egrave;tuere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Badate.<br
/>
La vostra ombra vi avr&agrave; fatto paura.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&mdash;<i>Filippo Pananti</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a feeling which, perhaps, all have felt at
times; . . . it is a strong and shuddering impression which
Coleridge has embodied in his own dark and supernatural verse
that Something not of earth is behind us&mdash;that if we turned
our gaze backward we should behold that which would make the
heart as a bolt of ice, and the eye shrivel and parch within its
socket.&nbsp; And so intense is the fancy, that <i>when</i> we
turn, and all is void, from that very void we could shape a
spectre as fearful as the image our terror had
foredrawn.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bulwer</span>, <i>The
Disowned</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The resemblance and the relation of the shadow to the body is
so strangely like that of the body to the soul, that it is very
possible that it first suggested the latter.&nbsp; It is born of
light, yet is in itself a portion of the mystery of darkness; it
is the facsimile of man in every outline, but in outline alone;
filled in with uniform sombre tint, it imitates our every action
as if in mockery, which of itself suggests a goblin or sprite,
while in it all there is something of self, darkling and
dream-like, yet never leaving us.&nbsp; It is only evident in
brightest hours, like a skeleton at an Egyptian feast, and it has
neither more nor less resemblance to man than the latter.&nbsp;
Hence it came that the strange &ldquo;dwellers by the Nile&rdquo;
actually <!-- page 238--><a name="page238"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 238</span>loved both shade and death by
association, and so it happened that</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Full
many a time<br />
They seemed half in love with easeful Death;<br />
Called him soft names in many a mused rhyme,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>while they made of the cool shadow a portion of the soul
itself, or rather one of the seven or eight entities of which man
consisted, these being&mdash;<i>Khat</i>, a body; <i>Ba</i>, the
spirit; <i>Khon</i>, the intelligence; <i>Kha&iuml;bit</i>,
<i>the shadow</i>; <i>Ren</i>, the name; <i>Ka</i>, eternal
vitality; <i>Ab</i>, the heart; and <i>Sahn</i>, the mask or
mummy.</p>
<p>It is extremely interesting to consider, in connection with
this Egyptian doctrine, the fact, illustrated by every writer on
Etruscan antiquity, that these ancient dwellers in Italy, when
they represented the departed, or the dead, as living again on a
tomb, added to the name of the deceased the word
<i>Hinthial</i>.&nbsp; This I once believed meant simply a ghost
or spirit.&nbsp; I had no other association with the name.</p>
<p>I inquired for a long time if there was any such name as
<i>Hintial</i> for a ghost among the people, and could not find
it.&nbsp; At last my chief agent succeeded in getting from
sources to me unknown, but, as in all cases, partly from natives
of the Toscana Romagna, or Volterra, and at different times, very
full information regarding this mysterious being, which I combine
as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

terror in a sorcerer, or in any one who has committed a

man, and addresses him thus:</p>

<p>I had the belief, derived from several writers, that
<i>Hinthial</i> in Etruscan meant simply a ghost or
<i>revenant</i>&mdash;the apparition of some one dead.&nbsp; But
on mentioning my <!-- page 245--><a name="page245"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 245</span>discovery of this legend to
Professor Milani, the Director of the Arch&aelig;ological Museum
in Florence, and the first of Etruscan scholars, he astonished me
by declaring that he believed the word signified a <i>shadow</i>,
and that its real meaning in its full significance had apparently
been marvellously preserved in this witch-tradition.&nbsp; Too
little is known as yet of the old Etruscan language to decide
with certainty as to anything in it, but should this opinion of
Professor Milani be sustained, it will appear that at least one
word of the mysterious tongue has existed till now in popular
tradition.</p>
<p>There will be very few of my readers who will not be struck,
as I was, with the remarkable resemblance of the terrible curse
uttered by Intialo to the invocation in Byron&rsquo;s tragedy of
&ldquo;Manfred.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is like it in form, spirit, and,
in many places, even in the very words.&nbsp; That there was,
however, no knowledge of the English poem by the Italian
witch-poet, and therefore no imitation, is plain from intrinsic
evidence.&nbsp; As the question is interesting, I will here give
the Incantation from &ldquo;Manfred&rdquo;:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">&ldquo;When the moon is on the wave,<br />

<p>The Italian poem forms, in its first and second parts, a drama
as complete as that of &ldquo;Manfred,&rdquo; and, as I hope to
render clear, one more consistent to the leading idea, or, as
critics were wont to say, &ldquo;more coherent in the
unities.&rdquo;&nbsp; This idea in the one, as in the other, is
that of a powerful <i>sorcerer</i> assailed by a fiend in the
form of remorse, and that with the most aggravating and insulting
terms of contempt.&nbsp; In &ldquo;Manfred&rdquo; the persecutor
tells his victim that he shall be his own hell, for that of all
poisons his own evil heart is the worst.&nbsp; The Italian, more
direct and less metaphysical still, alludes, in the accusation by
the spirit, to no other punishment save that of conscience, and
declares the magician to be poisoned through and through in
himself:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Tu sei cattivo e scelerato,<br />
Tu sei avvelenato<br />
Nel cuore e nell anima,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and bids him go forth to be for ever pursued by the
avenger.</p>
<p>Byron&rsquo;s poem is entirely based on sorcery, and is
intended to set forth the tremendous mental struggles of a <!--
page 248--><a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
248</span>mind which has risen above mankind with supernatural
power, which assails him with remorse.&nbsp; In the first place
he simply goes to sleep; in the grand finale he resists, like Don
Juan, or, as the saying is, &ldquo;dies
game&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;only this, and nothing
more&rdquo;&mdash;leaving all idea of an end, object, moral, or
system, entirely in the dark.&nbsp; &ldquo;Manfred&rdquo; is
merely dramatic for the sake of <i>stage effect</i>, and only
excellent in impressing us with the artistic skill of the
author.&nbsp; Its key is art for the sake of art, and effect on
anybody, no matter who.&nbsp; Within this limit it is most
admirable.</p>
<p>In both the Italian and English poems the one persecuted makes
his strong point of departure from the discovery or knowledge
that the persecuted is not one whom he has injured, but simply a
mocking and tormenting sprite.&nbsp; Thus the former text
declares that when he finds he is pursued simply by Intialo, the
shadow, which we may here translate &ldquo;his own
imagination,&rdquo; he rallies with a tremendous counter-curse in
which far more is meant than meets the eye.&nbsp; The grand
mission of the <i>magus</i> or sorcerer in all the occult lore of
all antiquity, whether he appear as Buddha or any other man of
men, is to conquer all enemies by tremendous power won by penance
or by iron <i>will</i>.&nbsp; A favourite means of tormenting the
enemy or fiend is to awaken the conscience of the magician, or,
what is the same thing, to tempt him to sin, as Satan did
Christ.&nbsp; But even conscience loses its power when we feel
that the foe is exaggerating our sins, and only urging them for
torment&rsquo;s sake, and especially when these sins are of a
kind which from a <i>certain</i> standpoint or code, are not sins
at all.</p>
<p>And here we are brought to a subject so strange and witch-like
that it is difficult to discuss or make clear.&nbsp; It is
evident enough in &ldquo;Manfred&rdquo; that the great crime was
the hero&rsquo;s forbidden love for his sister Astarte.&nbsp;
This it is which crushes him.&nbsp; But it does not appear from
the <!-- page 249--><a name="page249"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 249</span>Italian (save to those deeply
learned in the darker secrets of sorcery) why or how it is that
the one persecuted so suddenly revives and defies the spirit,
turning, as it were, his own power against him.&nbsp; In
explaining this, I do not in the least conjecture, guess, or
infer anything; I give the explanation as it was understood by
the narrator, and as confirmed by other legends and
traditions.&nbsp; It is this:</p>
<p>Michelet, in <i>La Sorci&eacute;re</i>, which amid much lunacy
or folly contains many truths and ingenious perceptions, has
explained that the witchcraft of the Middle Ages was a kind of
mad despairing revolt against the wrongs of society, of
feudalism, and the Church.&nbsp; It was in very truth the
precursor of Protestantism.&nbsp; Under the name of religion
conscience had been abused, and artificial sins, dooming to hell,
been created out of every trifle, and out of almost every form of
natural instincts.&nbsp; The reaction from this (which was a kind
of nihilism or anarchy), was to declare the antithetic
<i>excess</i> of free will.&nbsp; One of the forms of this revolt
was the belief that the greatest sorcerers were born (<i>ex filio
et matre</i>) from the nearest relations, and that to dare and
violate all such ties was to conquer by daring will the greatest
power.&nbsp; It was the strongest defiance of the morality taught
by the Church, therefore one of the highest qualifications for an
iron-willed magician.&nbsp; It is specially pointed out in the
legend of Diana that she began by such a sin, and so came to be
queen of the witches; and the same idea of entire emancipation or
illumination, or freedom from all ties, is the first step to the
absolute free will which constitutes the very basis of all
magic.&nbsp; This, which is repugnant to humanity, was actually
exalted by the Persian Magi to a duty or religious principle, and
it was the same in Egypt as regarded &ldquo;first
families.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sorcerer pursued by Intialo bases all
his power to resist on the mere fact that he is beloved by a
beautiful witch.&nbsp; This is the Astarte of the <!-- page
250--><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>Italian drama, or a sister&mdash;the terrible tie which
shows that a man is above conscience, and free from all fear of
the powers that be, whether of earth or air.&nbsp; By it his
triumph is complete.&nbsp; He surmounts the accusation of being
without morals by utterly denying their existence from a higher
or illuminated point of view.&nbsp; The <i>magus</i> claims to
rank with the gods, and if a divinity <i>creates</i> mankind as
his children, and then has a child by a woman, he is in the same
state as the sorcerer, according to wizards.</p>
<p>If any reproach attaches to the employment of such an element
in poetry, then Byron and Shelley are far more to blame than the
Italian witch-poet, who veiled his allusion with much greater
care than they did, and who had the vast excuse of <i>sincere
belief</i>, while their highest aim was mere art.&nbsp; The
wizard-poet has his heart in this faith, as in a religion, and he
is one with his hero.&nbsp; Manfred is at best only a broken-down
magician who presents a few boldly dramatic daring
traits&mdash;the Italian sorcerer, who is far more defiant and
fearless, conquers.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am more malignant than thou
art,&rdquo; is a terrible utterance; so is the tone of affected
pity for the baffled tormentor, in which we detect a shade of
sarcasm based on overwhelming triumph.&nbsp; This feeling, be it
observed, progresses, <i>crescendo forte</i>, gradually and very
artistically, from the first verse to the last.&nbsp; Intialo has
threatened to make the victim a sorry cur who comes at a call;
the sorcerer replies that he will make &ldquo;a swine&rsquo;s
snout&rdquo; of Intialo.&nbsp; Finally, he dares the fiend to
meet him at midnight at the great Witches&rsquo; Sabbat, at the
dread walnut-tree of Benevento.&nbsp; Here the threats reach an
ingenious and terrible climax, though the form in which they are
expressed is only quite clear to the initiated.&nbsp; The
sorcerer says, &ldquo;When thou thinkest that thou see&rsquo;st
my shadow thou wilt behold thine own,&rdquo; or in other words,
&ldquo;You who have sought to torment me by a <i>shadow</i> shall
<!-- page 251--><a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
251</span>yourself be mocked by finding that you are only
mine.&rdquo;&nbsp; This climax of daring the fiend to meet him at
Benevento, at the tremendous and terrible rendezvous of all the
devils, witches, and sorcerers, and then and there trying
conclusions with him in delusion and magic, or a strife of
shadows, while leaning against the awful tree itself, which is
the central point of the Italian Domdaniel, is magnificently
imagined.</p>
<p>In Goethe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Faust,&rdquo; as in Byron&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Manfred,&rdquo; the hero is a magician, but he is not in
either true to the name or character.&nbsp; The great
<i>magus</i> of early ages, even like the black Voodoo of
America, had it clearly before him all the time that his mission
or business, above all things, was to develop an indomitable
<i>will</i> superior to that of men or spirits.&nbsp; Every point
is gained by <i>force</i>, or by will and penance.&nbsp; In real
sorcery there is no such thing as a pact with a devil, and
becoming his slave after a time.&nbsp; This is a purely
later-Roman invention, a result of the adoption of the mixture of
Jewish monotheism and Persian dualism, which formed the Catholic
Church.&nbsp; In Goethe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Faust&rdquo; we have the
greatest weakness, and an extreme confusion of character.&nbsp;
The conclusion of the tale is contradictory or absurd, and the
difficulty is solved with the aid of a <i>Deus ex
machina</i>.&nbsp; The hero is a sorcerer, and <i>there is not a
trace of true sorcery or magianism or tremendous will and work in
the whole drama</i>.&nbsp; Beautiful things are said and done,
but, take it for all in all, it is a grand promenade which leads
to nothing. <a name="citation251"></a><a href="#footnote251"
class="citation">[251]</a></p>
<p>In the Italian legend, brief and rude as it is, there appears
a tremendous power worked out with great consistency.&nbsp; The
demon or spirit, intent on causing remorse or despair (<i>ad
affretare il rimorso</i>), threatens the sorcerer with terrible
maledictions.&nbsp; And these words, if we regard <!-- page
252--><a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
252</span>their real meaning and spirit, have never been
surpassed in any poem.</p>
<p>And we should note here that the Italian sorcerer who subdues
the devil by simple will and pluck is no Manfred or Faust drawn
from the religious spirit of the Middle Ages.&nbsp; He belongs to
the Etruscan age, or to that of the ancient Magi; he meets
malediction with malediction, spell with spell, curse with curse,
injury with injury, sarcasm and jeer with the same; he insults
the devil, calling him his slave:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Perche io sono di te&mdash;molto pi&ugrave;
maligno.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Until in the end they change parts, and the demon becomes the
one tormented.&nbsp; Therefore there is in this legend, with all
its rudeness, a conception which is so grand, as regards setting
forth the possible power of man, and the <i>eritis sicut deus</i>
of modern science, that it is in unity and fulness far beyond any
variant of the same subject.</p>
<p>That this is of great antiquity is clear, for out of this
enchanted forest of Italian witchcraft and mystical sorcery there
never yet came anything, great or small, which was not at least
of the bronze, if not of the neolithic age.</p>
<p>Truly, when the chief character in a tradition of the old
Etruscan land bears an Etruscan name, or that of a shadow called
a shadow, we may well conclude that it is not of yesterday.&nbsp;
So all things rise and bloom and pass away here on this earth to
winter and decay, and are as phantoms which</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Come like shadows, so depart.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a last word, &ldquo;Manfred&rdquo; and &ldquo;Faust&rdquo;
are only works of art, intended to &ldquo;interest&rdquo; or
amuse or charm the reader, and as such they are great.&nbsp; They
are simply dramas or show-pieces, which also give a high idea of
the artistic skill of their writers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Intialo&rdquo;
sets forth the great idea of the true sorcerer, in which they
both <i>fail</i>, and carries <!-- page 253--><a
name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>it out
logically to a tremendous triumph.&nbsp; It is the very
quintessence of all heresies, and of the first great heresy,
<i>eritis sicut deus</i>.</p>
<p>There will not be wanting one or two critics of the low kind
who take their hints from the disavowals of the author to declare
that his book is just what it is not, who will write that I think
I have discovered a better poet than Keats in Marietta Pery, and
a far greater than Goethe or Byron in the unknown author of the
invocation to &ldquo;Intialo.&rdquo;&nbsp; But all that I
<i>truly mean</i> is that the former is nearer to old tradition,
and more succinct than the English bard&mdash;&ldquo;only this
and nothing more&rdquo;&mdash;while in &ldquo;Intialo&rdquo; we
have given, as no one ever expressed it, the true ideal of the
magician who, overcoming all qualms of conscience, whether innate
or suggested, and trampling under foot all moral human
conventions, rises to <i>will</i>, and victory over all enemies,
especially the demons of the threshold.&nbsp; As a poem, I no
more claim special merit for it than I would for
Marietta&rsquo;s; <a name="citation253"></a><a
href="#footnote253" class="citation">[253]</a> indeed, to the
very considerable number of &ldquo;highly cultivated&rdquo;
people who only perceive poetry in form and style, and cannot
find it in the grandest conceptions unless they are elegantly
expressed, what I have given in this connection will not appear
as poetry at all.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">La
Scongiurazione dello Specchio</span>.<br />
<i>When one wishes to enchant a lover</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go at midnight when there is a fine full moon, and take
a small mirror, which must be kept in a box of a fine red colour,
and at each of the four corners of the box put a candle with a
pin, or with a pin in its point, and observe that two of the pins
must have red heads, and two black, and form a cross, and note
that every candle must have two tassels hanging from it, one red
and one black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And within the box first of all put a good layer of
coarse salt, and form on the salt a ring or wreath of incense,
and in the middle of this a cross of cummin, and above all put
the small mirror.&nbsp; Then take the photograph of your lover,
but not the real photograph but the negative, because it must be
on a plate of glass (<i>lastra di vetro</i>).&nbsp; Then take
some hairs of <!-- page 255--><a name="page255"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 255</span>the lover and join them to the
photograph (<i>sono uniti dalla parte del quore</i>), and then
take a fine sprig of rue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And with all this nicely arranged in the box, take a
boat and sail out to sea; and if a woman works the spell she must
take three men with her only, and if a man three women and no
other person.&nbsp; And they must go forth at an instant when the
moon shines brightly (<i>risplende bene</i>) on the mirror.&nbsp;
Then hold the left hand over the mirror, and hold up the rue with
the right.&nbsp; Then repeat the following: <a

<p>Before proceeding further, I would explain that the use of a
photograph, which must be a negative on glass, instead of being,
as was suggested to me, a modern interpolation, is, strangely
enough, a proof of the antiquity of the rite.&nbsp; In the old
time, a picture or portrait painted in transparent colour on
glass was held up to the moon that its rays might pass through it
and enchant the subject.&nbsp; And among the Romans, when one had
a portrait of any one cut on diaphanous stone, it was used in the
same way.&nbsp; I had in my possession once such a portrait-gem,
<a name="citation259b"></a><a href="#footnote259b"
class="citation">[259b]</a> and a fine needle-hole had been bored
through the right eye so as to blind the original of the
likeness.&nbsp; And I had a friend who lived in Russia, who
discovered that a person who hated him had obtained his
photograph, and pricked holes with a very fine needle in the eyes
to blind him.&nbsp; The negative of a photograph on glass would
very naturally occur as a substitute for a picture.&nbsp; But
what is most important is that this mention of the translucent
negative proves fully that the whole ceremony, in its <!-- page
260--><a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>minutest detail, has actually been preserved to this
day, and that the incantation, long as it is, exists as I have
given it, since every line in it corresponds to the rite.&nbsp;
And as I know that it was gathered by a witch and fortune-teller
among others, and carefully compared and collated, I am sure that
it is authentic and traditional.</p>
<p>Fifty pages are devoted by the Rev. T. Harley in his
&ldquo;Moon Lore&rdquo; to the subject of the Man in the Moon,
and since the book appeared in 1885 there have been great
additions to the subject.&nbsp; This human being is declared by
myths found in India, and especially among the Oriental gypsies,
in Ireland, Borneo, Greenland, and South America, to be a man who
is punished by imprisonment above for incest with his sister the
sun.&nbsp; As he wanders for ever over the heavens, just as
gypsies wander on earth, they claim him for their ancestor, and
declare that Zin-gan (or gypsy) is derived from two words meaning
sun and moon.&nbsp; <i>Kam</i>, the sun, has been varied to
<i>kan</i>, and in gypsy the moon is called <i>chone</i>, which
is also <i>t-chen</i>, <i>chin</i>, or <i>sin</i>.&nbsp; But the
point lies in this, that Cain was condemned to be a &ldquo;a
fugitive and a vagabond in the earth,&rdquo; which gives much
apparent strength to the idea that Cain, whether Shemitic or
Aryan, was, for a great crime, or as chief of sinners, imprisoned
in the moon.</p>
<p>This sufferer, in different legends, has been represented as a
Sabbath-breaker, as Judas Iscariot, as Isaac, and many more
transgressors, almost always with a <i>bunch</i> or <i>bush</i>
of <i>thorns</i>, for which there has been literally no real
explanation whatever.&nbsp; This I will now investigate, and, I
think, clearly explain.</p>
<p>Dante in two places speaks of the Man in the Moon as Cain, and
as if it were a very popular legend (<i>Inferno</i>, xx.
123):</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ma vienne omai che gi&agrave; tiene
&rsquo;l confine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; D&rsquo;ambedue gli emisperi, e tocca
l&rsquo;onda<br />
Sotto Sibilia, Caino e le spine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; E gia iernotte fu la Luna tonda.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 261--><a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
261</span>&ldquo;But now he comes who doth the borders hold<br />
Of the two hemispheres, and drive the waves<br />
Under the sibyl, Cain, with many thorns.<br />
And yesternight the moon was round and full;<br />
Take care that it may never do thee harm<br />
At any time when in the gloomy wood.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This twentieth canto is devoted to the sorcerers in hell, and
ends with allusion to the full moon, the sibyl, and Cain, as
allied to witchcraft, prediction, and sin.&nbsp; When the moon is
full it is also &ldquo;high tides&rdquo; with the witches, now as
of yore:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Full moon, high sea,<br />
Great man shalt thou be:<br />
Red dawning, cloudy sky,<br />
Bloody death shalt thou die.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dante again mentions Cain in the moon, in the <i>Paradiso</i>,
ii. 50:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ma ditemi, che con li segni lui<br />
Dio questo corpo, che laggiuso in terra<br />
Fan di <i>Cain</i> favoleggiare altrui?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tell me now what are the gloomy marks<br />
Upon this body, which down there on earth<br />
Make people tell so many tales of Cain?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which Beatrice replies by a mysterious physical explanation
of the phenomenon, advising him to take three <i>mirrors</i> and
observe how the moon is reflected from one to the other, and that
in this manner the <i>formal principio</i>, or first creative
power, passes from light to darkness.&nbsp; The reader will here
remember that with the witches the <i>mirror</i> is specially
devoted to conjuring Cain.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that a <i>spechietto</i>, or small
looking-glass, was specially (Barretti) &ldquo;a little mirror
placed at the bottom of a jewel casket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would now note that the <i>thorns</i> which Cain carries
signify, not only in modern Italian, but in old Roman sorcery,
the sting of hatred and of jealousy.&nbsp; It is a most apparent
and natural simile, and is found from the crown of thorns on
Christ to the Voodoo sorcery in Western <!-- page 262--><a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span>America.&nbsp; Miss Mary Owen knew a black girl in
Missouri who, as a proof of being Christianised, threw away the
thorn which she kept as a fetish to injure an enemy.&nbsp; But in
early times the thorn was universally known as symbolical of sin,
just as Cain was regarded as the first real sinner.&nbsp;
Therefore the two were united.&nbsp; Menzel tells us in his
<i>Christliche Symbolik</i> (Part I. p. 206) that it is a legend
that &ldquo;there were no thorns before the Fall; they first grew
with sin, therefore thorns are a symbol of the sorrow or pain
which came from sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of all of which there is a mass
of old German myths and legends, which I spare the reader, for I
have endeavoured in this comment to avoid useless myth-mongering
in order to clearly set forth the connection between Cain, his
thorns, and the moon.</p>
<p>That the conjuring the moon with a mirror is very ancient
indeed appears from the legend drawn from classic sources, which
is thus set forth in &ldquo;A Pleasant Comedie called
Summer&rsquo;s Last Will and Testament.&nbsp; Written by Thomas
Nash.&nbsp; London, 1600&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In laying thus the blame upon the Moone<br
/>
Thou imitat&rsquo;st subtill Pythagoras,<br />
Who what he would the People should beleeve,<br />
The same he wrote with blood upon a Glasse,<br />
And turned it opposite &rsquo;gainst the New Moone,<br />
Whose Beames, reflecting on it with full force,<br />
Shew&rsquo;d all those lines to them that stood behinde,<br />
Most pleynly writ in circle of the Moone,<br />
And then he said: &lsquo;Not I, but the newe Moone<br />
Fair Cynthia persuades you this and that.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the &ldquo;Clouds&rdquo; of Aristophanes the same idea is
made into a jest, in which Strepsiades thus addresses
Socrates:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Strepsiades</i>.&nbsp; If I were to buy
a Thessalian witch, and then draw down the moon by night, and
then shut her up in a round helmet-case <i>like a mirror</i>, and
then keep watching her&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Socrates</i>.&nbsp; What good would that do you, then?</p>
<p><i>Strepsiades</i>.&nbsp; What!&nbsp; If the moon were not to
rise any more anywhere, I should not pay the interest.</p>
<p><i>Socrates</i>.&nbsp; Because what?</p>
<p><i>Strepsiades</i>.&nbsp; Because the money is lent on
interest.&rdquo; <a name="citation262"></a><a href="#footnote262"
class="citation">[262]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 263--><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>These instances could be multiplied.&nbsp; What I have
given are enough to show the antiquity of the conjuration; and I
also venture to declare that any Italian scholar who is familiar
with these formulas of sorcery will admit that, making all due
allowance for transmission among peasants, the language, or
words, or turns of expression in this incantation denote great
antiquity.</p>
<p>The next paper or tradition on the subject of Cain, which, as
every phrase in it indicates, was taken down from an old dame who
at first slowly recalled forgotten sentences, will be to many
more interesting, and to all much more amusing than the
first.&nbsp; It once happened that an old gypsy in England began
to tell me the story of the ghostly baker of Stonehenge and the
seven loaves, but, suddenly pausing, he said: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
the use of telling that to <i>you</i> who have <i>read</i> it all
in the Bible?&rdquo;&nbsp; There is, however, this trifling
difference, that I am not sure that my Italian witch friends knew
that Cain and Abel are in the Bible at all.&nbsp; The Red Indian
doctor, whose knowledge of the Old Testament was limited to its
being good to cure neuralgia, was far beyond the <i>contadini</i>
as regards familiarity with &ldquo;the efficacy of the
Scripture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the witch-tale as written word by word:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Abele e
Chaino</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were two brothers.&nbsp; Abel greatly loved Cain,
but Cain did not love so much the brother Abel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cain had no great will to work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abel, however, on the contrary, was greatly disposed
(<i>si ingegnava</i>) to labour, because he had found it
profitable.&nbsp; He was industrious in all, and at last became a
grazier (<i>mercante di manzi</i>).</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Cain also, being moved by jealousy (<i>per
astia</i>), wished to become a grazier, but the wheel did not
turn for him as it did for Abel.</p>
<p><!-- page 264--><a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>&ldquo;And Cain also was a good man, and set himself
contentedly to work, believing that he could become as rich as
his brother, but he did not succeed in this, for which reason he
became so envious of Abel that it resulted in tremendous hate,
and he swore to be revenged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cain often visited his brother, and once said to him,
&lsquo;Abel, thou art rich and I am poor; give me the half of thy
wealth, since thou wishest me so well!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Abel replied: &lsquo;If I give thee a sum which
thou thyself couldst gain by industry, thou shouldst still labour
as I do, and I will give thee nothing, since, if thou wilt work
as I do, thou wilt become as rich.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day there were together Cain, Abel, and a merchant,
whose name I forget.&nbsp; And one told that he had seen in a
dream seven fat oxen and seven lean.&nbsp; And the merchant, who
was an astrologer or wizard, explained that the seven fat oxen
meant seven years of abundance, and the seven lean as many years
of famine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so it came to pass as he foretold&mdash;seven years
of plenty and seven of famine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Cain, hearing this, thought: &lsquo;During the
seven years of plenty Abel will lay by a great store, and then I
will slay him, and possess myself of all his goods, and thus I
will take care of myself, and my brother will be dead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Cain greatly loved God; he was good towards God,
more so than Abel, because Abel, having become rich, never spoke
more unto the Lord; and Abel would gladly have become a wizard
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Cain began to think how he could slay Abel and
become a merchant in his place, and so went forth to cut
wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day he called his brother Abel, and said to him:
&lsquo;Thou art so rich, while I am poor, and all my work avails
me little.&rsquo;&nbsp; And with that he gave Abel a blow with a
knife, and dressed himself in his garments, and took a bundle of
thorns on his back, and thus clad he took Abel&rsquo;s place as
merchant, believing that no one would recognise him as Cain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And while thus buying and selling he met the
merchant-wizard who had foretold the seven years of famine and of
abundance.&nbsp; And he said, &lsquo;Oh, good day, Abel,&rsquo;
to make Cain believe that he was not discovered.&nbsp; But the
oxen who were present all began to chant in chorus:</p>

<p>&ldquo;A punishment thou shalt have because thou didst slay
thy brother from a desire to become rich.&nbsp; Likewise thou
didst meddle with witchcraft and sorceries, as did thy
brother.&nbsp; And Abel made much money and was very rich,
because he did not love God, but sorcerers.&nbsp; Albeit, ever
good he never <!-- page 266--><a name="page266"></a><span

wherefore God pardoned him.&nbsp; But thou shalt not be pardoned
because thou didst imbrue thy lands in human blood, and, what is
worse, in thy own brother&rsquo;s blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The punishment which I inflict is this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thorns <a name="citation266"></a><a

put upon thy brother are now for thee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou shalt be imprisoned in the moon, and from that
place shalt behold the good and the evil of all mankind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the bundle of thorns shall never leave thee, and
every time when any one shall conjure thee, the thorns shall
sting thee cruelly; they shall draw thy blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thus shalt thou be compelled to do that which shall
be required of thee by the sorcerers or by conjuring, and if they
ask of thee that which thou wilt not give, then the thorns shall
goad thee until the sorceries shall cease.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>This is clearly enough no common popular nursery tale, such as
make up collections of Tuscan tales or popular legends, gathered
from pious or picturesque peasants.&nbsp; Through it all runs a
deep current of dark heresy, the deliberate contravention of
accepted Scripture, and chiefly the spell of sorcery and deadly
witchcraft.&nbsp; It is a perfect and curious specimen of a kind
of forbidden literature which was common during the Middle Ages,
and which is now extremely rare.&nbsp; This literature or lore
was the predecessor of Protestantism, and was the rock on which
it was based.</p>
<p>There have always been in the world since time began certain
good people whose taste or fate it was to be invariably on the
wrong side, or in the opposition; like the Irishman just landed
from a ship in America, who, being asked how he would vote,
replied, &ldquo;Against the Government, of course, whatever it
is,&rdquo; they are always at war with the powers that be.&nbsp;
With Jupiter they would have opposed the Titans; with Prometheus,
Jupiter; <!-- page 267--><a name="page267"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 267</span>as early Christians they would have
rebelled against the Pagans, and as heretics, Orientalised
Templars, Vaudois, illuminati, sorcerers, and witches, they would
have undermined the Church, never perceiving that its system or
doctrine was, <i>au fond</i>, fetish, like their own.&nbsp; Among
these rebels it was long the rule to regard those gods or men who
were specially reviled by their foes or oppressors as
calumniated.&nbsp; Even Satan was to them &ldquo;the puir
deil;&rdquo; according to the Taborites, an oppressed elder
brother of Christ, or a kind of Man in an Iron Mask kept out of
his rights by Jehovah the XIV.&nbsp; These discontented ones
deified all who had been devilled, found out that Jezebel had
been a <i>femme incomprise</i>, and the Scarlet Woman only an
interesting highly-coloured variant of the ancient hoary myth of
Mademoiselle or Miss Salina the Innocent.&nbsp; When Judas was
mentioned, they solemnly remarked that there was a great deal to
be said on both sides of <i>that</i> question; while others
believed that Ananias and Sapphira had been badly sat upon, and
deserved to be worshipped as saints of appropriation&mdash;a
cult, by the way, the secret observance of which has by no means
died out at the present day&mdash;several great men being
regarded in Paris as its last great high priests.</p>
<p>The Cainites, as known by that name to the Church, were a
Gnostic sect of the second century, and are first mentioned by
Iren&aelig;us, who connects them with the Valentinians, of whom I
thought but yesterday when I saw in a church a sarcophagus
warranted to contain the corpse of St. Valentine.&nbsp; They
believed that Cain derived his existence from the supreme power,
but Abel from the inferior, and that in this respect he was the
first of a line which included Esau, Korah, the dwellers in Sodom
and Gomorrah, the worshippers of Ashtoreth-Mylitta, or the
boundless sensualists, the sorcerers, and witches.</p>
<p>Considering what human nature is, and its instincts to
opposition, we can see that there must have been naturally <!--
page 268--><a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
268</span>a sect who regarded Cain as a misjudged martyr.&nbsp;
Abel appeared to them as the prosperous well-to-do bourgeois,
high in favour with the Lord, a man with flocks, while Cain was a
tiller of the ground, a poor peasant out of favour.&nbsp; It must
be admitted that in the Book of Genesis, in the history of the
first murder, we are much reminded of the high priest Chalcas in
<i>La Belle Helene</i>, where he exclaims, &ldquo;<i>Trop de
fleurs</i>!&rdquo; and expresses a preference for cattle.&nbsp;
It is the old story of the socialists and anarchists, which is
ever new.</p>
<p>The witches and sorcerers of early times were a widely spread
class who had retained the beliefs and traditions of heathenism
with all its license and romance and charm of the
forbidden.&nbsp; At their head were the Promethean Templars, at
their tail all the ignorance and superstition of the time, and in
their ranks every one who was oppressed or injured either by the
nobility or the Church.&nbsp; They were treated with
indescribable cruelty, in most cases worse than beasts of burden,
for they were outraged in all their feelings, not at intervals
for punishment, but habitually by custom, and they revenged
themselves by secret orgies and fancied devil-worship, and occult
ties, and stupendous sins, or what they fancied were such.&nbsp;
I can seriously conceive&mdash;what no writer seems to have
considered&mdash;that there must have been an immense
satisfaction in selling or giving one&rsquo;s self to the devil,
or to any power which was at war with their oppressors.&nbsp; So
they went by night, at the full moon, and sacrificed to Diana, or
&ldquo;later on&rdquo; to Satan, and danced and rebelled.&nbsp;
It is very well worth noting that we have <i>all</i> our accounts
of sorcerers and heretics from Catholic priests, who had every
earthly reason for misrepresenting them, and did so.&nbsp; In the
vast amount of ancient witchcraft still surviving in Italy there
is not much anti-Christianity, but a great deal of early
heathenism.&nbsp; Diana, not Satan, is still the real head of the
witches.&nbsp; The Italian witch, as the priest Grillandus said,
<!-- page 269--><a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
269</span>stole oil to make a love-charm. <a
name="citation269"></a><a href="#footnote269"
class="citation">[269]</a>&nbsp; But she did not, and does not
say, as he declared, in doing so, &ldquo;I renounce
Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; There the priest plainly lied.&nbsp; The
whole history of the witch mania is an ecclesiastical falsehood,
in which such lies were subtly grafted on the truth.&nbsp; But in
due time the Church, and the Protestants with them, created a
Satanic witchcraft of their own, and it is this after-growth
which is now regarded as witchcraft in truth.</p>
<p>Cain-worshippers and witches seem to have been all in the same
boat.&nbsp; I think it very likely that in these two traditions
which I have given we have a remnant of the actual literature of
the Cainites, that Gnostic-revived and mystical sect of the
Middle Ages.&nbsp; But I doubt not that its true origin is far
older than Christianity, and lost in earliest time.</p>
<p>One last remark.&nbsp; We are told in the tale that Abel,
having become rich, &ldquo;cut&rdquo; the Lord, or would speak to
him no longer.&nbsp; I suppose that he dropped the synagogue and
<i>Yom kippur</i>, and became a <i>Reformirter</i>, and his
children in due time <i>Goyim</i>.&nbsp; Also that he wanted to
become a wizard, which may be a hint that he was &ldquo;no
conjuror.&rdquo;&nbsp; But it is seriously a proof of the
na&iuml;vet&eacute;, and consequent probable antiquity of the
tale, that these details are not &ldquo;wrote sarcastic,&rdquo;
nor intended for humour.&nbsp; And it is also interesting to
observe how impartially the narrator declares that Cain was
&ldquo;a good man,&rdquo; and how he, in pleading his own cause
before the Lord, insists that in killing Abel he only
inadvertently forgot himself for an instant.&nbsp; One almost
expects to hear him promise that he will not do it again.</p>
<p>It is a striking proof of the antiquity of this tradition <!--
page 270--><a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
270</span>of Cain, as I have given it, that the witch or wizard
sympathy for the first murderer is in it unmistakable.&nbsp; The
sending Cain to the moon, instead of hell, is understood to be a
mitigation of his sentence.&nbsp; In his work on magicians and
witches, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1707, Goldschmidt
devotes many pages to set forth what was believed by all the
learned of his time, that Cain was the father of all the wizards,
and his children, the Cainites, the creators of the <i>Gaber</i>,
fire-idolators, Cabiri, magic soothsaying, and so forth.&nbsp; So
the tradition lived on, utterly forgotten by all good people, and
yet it is to me so quaint as to be almost touching to find it
still existing, a fragment of an old creed outworn here among
poor witches in Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sacher Masoch,&rdquo; a Galician novelist, informs us
in a romance, &ldquo;The Legacy of Cain,&rdquo; that the Cainites
still exist in Russia, and that their religion is represented by
the following charming creed:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Satan is the master of the world; therefore
it is a sin to belong to Church or State, and marriage is also a
capital sin.&nbsp; Six things constitute the legacy of Cain:
Love, Property, Government, War, and Death.&nbsp; Such was the
legacy of Cain, who was condemned to be a wanderer and a fugitive
on earth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have another apparently very ancient conjuration of a
mirror, in two parts.&nbsp; It is of the blackest witchcraft, of
the most secret kind, and is only intended to injure an
enemy.</p>
<p>From an article in <i>La Rivista delle Tradizione Popolare</i>
of July 1894, by F. Montuori, I learn that in a little work by
San Prato on &ldquo;Cain and the Thorns according to Dante and
Popular Tradition,&rdquo; Ancona, 1881, which I have not seen,
the history of Cain is given much as told by Maddalena.&nbsp;
What is <i>chiefly</i> interesting in the version of Maddalena
is, however, wanting in all the folklore on the subject collected
by others; it is the manifest trace of Cainism, of sympathy with
the first murder, and in its heresy.&nbsp; This opens for us a
far wider field of research <!-- page 271--><a
name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>and
valuable historical information than the rather trivial fact that
Cain is simply the Man in the Moon.</p>
<p>Merk in <i>Die Sitten und Gebr&auml;uche der Deutschen</i>,
gives (p. 644), from Wolf, a strange legend which is nearly
allied to Moon worship by witches, and the mirror:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There was a man in Kortryk who was called
Klare Mone (bright moon), and he got his name from this.&nbsp;
One night when sleeping on his balcony he heard many
women&rsquo;s voices sweetly singing.&nbsp; They held goblets
[there is some confusion here with <i>gl&auml;serne Pfannen</i>
or glass panes in the roof from which the man looked; I infer
that the witches drank from &ldquo;glass pans,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i>, metallic mirrors], and as they drank they sang:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We are drinking the sweetest of earthly wine,<br
/>
For we drink of the clear and bright moonshine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But as the man approached them, &lsquo;with a club to
beat or kill them, all vanished.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Which fable teaches,&rdquo; as the wise Flaxius notes,
&ldquo;what indeed this whole book tends to show&mdash;that few
people know or heed what witches ever really were.&nbsp; Now,
that this boor wished to slay the sorceresses with a club, for
drinking moonshine, is only what the whole world is doing to all
who have <i>different ideas from ours</i> as to what constitutes
enjoyment.&nbsp; So in all history, under all creeds, even unto
this day, people have been clubbed, hung, tortured, and baked
alive, or sent to Coventry for the crime of drinking
<i>moonshine</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so this volume ends, oh reader mine!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;So the visions flee,<br />
So the dreams depart;<br />
And the sad reality,<br />
Now must act its part.&rdquo;<br />
<i>Ite</i>, <i>lector benevole</i>,<br />
<i>Ite</i>, <i>missa est</i>.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
